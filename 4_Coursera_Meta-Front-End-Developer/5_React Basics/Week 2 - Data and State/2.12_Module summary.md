You've reached the end of this module exploring the concept of data and states. 

It's now time to recap the key lessons and skills you've learned. 

You began the module with dynamic events and how to handle them in react native. 

You discovered how to identify common types of events and react. 

Handle events by using components and 

write event-handling code using different types of syntax. 

The next lesson that you encountered focused on data, and event and react. 

Now that you've completed this lesson, you can describe how data flows in react, 

including data from a parent to a child component. 

Explain what state is and how it relates to component behavior. 

And describe some common approaches for state management. 

To sum it up in this module, you've learned about two of 

the most important things that make react apps interactive namely state and events. 

In the upcoming module, you'll learn about working with links and 

routing as well as using assets in react. 

This should finalize your preparations for 

coding your own portfolio project in react. 

Excellent. 

You've made great progress in your journey towards becoming a react developer
