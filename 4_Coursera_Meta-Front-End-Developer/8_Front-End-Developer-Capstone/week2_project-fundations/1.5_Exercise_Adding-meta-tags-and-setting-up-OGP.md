# 1.5_Exercise: Adding meta tags and setting up OGP

## Overview

Building a website is an important part of marketing a business. Equally, word of mouth and social media are important for bringing in new customers. In this exercise, you will prepare the Little Lemon web app for search engines and social media platforms, by adding meta tags and setting up Open Graph protocol (OGP).

## Scenario

Potential customers may also try to find the website using popular search engines.
