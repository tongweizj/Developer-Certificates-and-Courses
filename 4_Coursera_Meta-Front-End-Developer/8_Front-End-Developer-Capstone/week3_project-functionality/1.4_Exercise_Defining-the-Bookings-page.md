Exercise: Defining the Bookings page
====================================

**Overview**
------------

Now that you’ve set up the foundations of the project, the next step is to begin adding the key features of the Little Lemon web app.In this exercise, you’ll set up the table booking page.

**Scenario**
------------

Currently, a visitor to the Little Lemon web app cannot reserve a table.  Your task is to improve the app by allowing the user to enter data into the form so that they can complete their registration.
  Thus, you need to build a **Booking Form** component that has the following entries (form items):

*   Date
*   Time
*   Number of guests
*   Occasion (Birthday, Anniversary)
*   Submit reservation button (to submit the form)

To do this, you need to implement a form in a controlled component named BookingForm. As you progress through the exercise, it may be helpful to revisit the following lesson items:

*   [Creating a form](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth/lecture/NDMJL/creating-a-form)

*   [What are controlled components?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/lecture/sAx7F/what-are-controlled-components)

*   [Creating a Form component in React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/lecture/VpQWd/creating-a-form-component-in-react)

*   [Observing state](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/lecture/1XZnE/observing-state)


**Instructions**
----------------

### **Step 1: Check the component and routes**

If you haven’t done so already, create the BookingForm and BookingPage components. The BookingPage will contain the BookingForm component, in addition to any additional content before and after the form.

**Note:** Before proceeding to the next step, check that your routes and navigation bar are set up to allow navigation to the booking page.

### **Step 2: Code the form structure**

Next, you’ll need to build the form structure in the BookingForm component. You can use the following plain HTML5 implementation as a starting point, however, you should convert it to JSX so that you can later connect the input to the React state.
```js
<form style\="display: grid; max-width: 200px; gap: 20px"\>

   <label for\="res-date"\>Choose date</label\>

   <input type\="date" id\="res-date"\>

   <label for\="res-time"\>Choose time</label\>

   <select id\="res-time "\>

      <option\>17:00</option\>

      <option\>18:00</option\>

      <option\>19:00</option\>

      <option\>20:00</option\>

      <option\>21:00</option\>

      <option\>22:00</option\>

   </select\>

   <label for\="guests"\>Number of guests</label\>

   <input type\="number" placeholder\="1" min\="1" max\="10" id\="guests"\>

   <label for\="occasion"\>Occasion</label\>

   <select id\="occasion"\>

      <option\>Birthday</option\>

      <option\>Anniversary</option\>

   </select\>

   <input type\="submit" value\="Make Your reservation"\>

</form\>
```


**Note:** Keep in mind the difference between the for attribute in HTML and htmlFor in JSX. Also, remember to self-close all tags in JSX.

### **Step 3: Code the form behavior**

Using what you already know about events, effects and state in React, update your form's code to keep track of its own state.

*   Define a state variable for field in the form.
    
*   Connect each state variable to the form fields using the value and onChange form element attributes.
    
*   The options in the booking time field should be displayed from a list of available times. For now, create a stateful array in the component named availableTimes and use this state variable to populate the time select field options.
预订时间字段中的选项应从可用时间列表中显示。 
现在，在名为 availableTimes 的组件中创建一个有状态数组，并使用此状态变量来填充时间选择字段选项。

**Tip:** Use the useState function to declare the variable.

Now that the state is connected to the input elements, the form is ready to communicate with an API, a task you may complete in future.

**Conclusion**
--------------

By completing this exercise, you’ve created the component of the Bookings page for customers to reserve a table. In the next lesson, you’ll work on lifting up the state and connecting the component to the list of available reservation times.
通过完成本练习，您已经创建了“预订”页面的组件，供客户预订餐桌。 在下一课中，您将致力于提升状态并将组件连接到可用预订时间列表。
