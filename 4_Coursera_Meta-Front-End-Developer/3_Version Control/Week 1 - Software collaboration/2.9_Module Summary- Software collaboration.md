Well done. 

You've reached the end of this introductory module on 

software collaboration. 

It's now time to review what you've learned during these lessons. 

This module started with a case study about how software engineers collaborate 

across the globe without wrecking one another's code. 

You then began to explore the answer to the question, what is version control? 

You learned to describe how modern software teams collaborate and 

work on the same code base, list different version control systems, explain different 

version control methodologies, and explored software development workflows. 

You learned about the history of version control and 

that it has been in use before the internet was widely adopted. 

You explored conflict resolution, and discovered the important role of 

version control in the software development process. 

You learned about some of the common tools and 

strategies developers used to implement version control such as workflow, 

continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment. 

The differences between staging and production were explored and 

you learned that the staging environment should mimic your production environment. 

You also learned the many areas that benefit from creating a staging 

environment, including new features, testing, 

migrations and configuration changes. 

You learned that any issues should be caught and 

fixed in the staging environment before going live in production. 

You have also explored downtime, vulnerabilities and 

reputation regarding production. 

You should now be familiar with version control. 

Well done. 

You're making good progress on your learning journey
