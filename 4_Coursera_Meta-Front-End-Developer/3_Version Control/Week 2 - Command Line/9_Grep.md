Grep stands for global regular expression print. 

And it's used for searching across files and 

folders as well as the contents of files. 

On my local machine, I enter the command ls -l, and 

see that there's a file called names.txt. 

If I access that file using the lass command, it displays a list of first 

names in non sequential order, as in, not arranged alphabetically. 

So what I'll do first is use Grep to find some patterns of names that start 

with similar matches. 

Then I'll also show how great can be passed with different flags to 

get different results. 

First I'll perform a standard search using Grep. 

So what I'm going to do is look for names that begin with Sam, 

by entering the command, grep Sam names.txt. 

This then returns a list of names that begin with Sam. 

Keep in mind that Grep is case sensitive, which means if I run the same query 

with a lower case S, it returns a completely different set of results. 

Because this query doesn't match the capital S, it returns partial matches 

in which Sam appears in the middle or end of a name rather than the beginning. 

Fortunately I can pass in a flag to ignore case sensitivity. 

I can do this with a command, grep -i, followed by the keyword Sam. 

And then the file name names.txt again. 

This time I get back both users that begin with Sam and 

also with Sam as a partial match in the middle or the end of the name. 

So the results set changes based on the type of query that I passed through with 

different flags. 

We could also do an exact match by passing in a different flag, and 

that's the dash W. 

Which means it'll match exactly what I'm looking for. 

So I'll input, grep -w, and then pass in the key word Sam, 

with a capital S, and finally our file name names.txt. 

In this case we only get back a single result with the name Sam, 

as any partial matches are ignored. 

Lastly, I can use a pipe command to combine different searches for 

Grep itself. 

For example, let's say I went to search across a list of directories for 

certain, executable files. 

I can combine that with different commands and 

search across the file structure to find exactly what I'm looking for. 

If I check all the executable files inside the bin directory by running, 

ls /bin, it returns a long list of results. 

In order to filter that down, I can run the same query of ls /bin, 

but this time I'm going to pipe it.

Pass in a Grep and then enter the keyword zip. 

You'll find that in this case I get a much smaller subset back in the results. 

And if I need to refine it further, then I can also apply the different flags to 

look for an exact match, a partial match or ignore case sensitivity.
