So first I went to check what current directory I'm in by using 

the PWD command and pressing the enter key. 

You can see that I'm in the root directory which displays as forward/root. 

If I type in the LS-L command notice that I have one 

directory in here called projects. 

Now I will create a new directory called submissions. 

I do this by typing mkdir, which stands for make directory. 

And then the word submissions. 

This is the name of the directory I want to create and then I hit the enter key. 

I then type in ls-l for list so that I can see the list structure. 

And now notice that a new directory called submissions has been created. 

I can then go into this directory using the change directory command. 

I do this by typing cd submissions and then press the enter key. 

I type the ls command and notice that there's nothing in there. 

If I want to add some text files or some content, 

I can use another command called touch. 

I type touch test1.txt, followed by the enter key.

Play video starting at :1:18 and follow transcript1:18

To add another text file, I type in touch 

test2.txt followed by the entry key again. 

Now I run the ls-l command and 

noticed that the two text files are listed inside the submissions folder. 

After this, I want to go back to the root level directory and 

I do this by typing in cd..followed by the enter key. 

And then I run the ls-l command again and 

notice two directories are now listed, projects and submissions. 

Now I want to create another directory called archive. 

To do this type mkdir followed by the word archive and then hit the enter key. 

To see all of the directories, 

enter the ls-l command followed by the entry key again. 

Once again, notice that three directories are now listed, archive, 

projects and submissions. 

To get back to the top view of my terminal, 

I can clear my screen by typing clear, followed by the enter key. 

After this, I type in the ls-l command and now I can see all three directories. 

Okay, so 

let's say I want to move the submissions folder into the archive folder. 

This requires a different command called move written as mv. 

In this example, I need to specify the directory I want to move and 

then where to move it to. 

So I type in mv submissions followed by the word archive and 

then I hit the enter key. 

Then I can check to see if the move happened by using the ls-l command and 

now notice that the submissions directory is gone. 

So now I want to go to the archive directory by typing cd archive. 

Again, I use the ls-l command and now notice that the submissions 

directory is listed inside of the archive directory. 

Recall that I created two text files inside the submissions directory. 

Well, you'll notice that they were also moved to the archive directory. 

So I go to the submissions directory by typing cd submissions, 

which changes the directory. 

I use the ls-l command, followed by the enter key. 

And now you can see the two text files are present and they were moved too. 

You have now learned how to make directories and files and 

move directories and files.
