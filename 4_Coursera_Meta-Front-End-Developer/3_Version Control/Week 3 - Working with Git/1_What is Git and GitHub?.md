Are you familiar with 

version control or version control systems? 

Here's a quick example of where they're useful. 

Have you ever opened an app on your phone and 

received a prompt to update to a new version? 

These prompts most likely direct you towards 

an app store where you then download the latest version. 

As you download the new version, 

you might notice a new layout, 

button, or piece of functionality. 

In software and web development, 

developers use version control 

to track the differences between versions. 

A popular method of tracking versions is 

the use of version control technologies, 

like Git and GitHub. 

In this video, you'll 

discover the answer to the question, 

what is Git and GitHub? 

You will learn about the differences 

between Git and GitHub, 

and how web developers make use of them, 

and explore the benefits and advantages of both services. 

Let's start off with Git. 

Git is a version control system designed to help 

users keep track of changes 

to files within their projects. 

Git was designed to fix the problem that it's created, 

Linus Torvalds was having with managing 

the huge challenge of keeping 

track of all changes to the kernel, 

the operating system for Linux. 

Linux has thousands of contributors 

who commit changes and updates daily. 

Git was designed to help with the challenge 

of tracking all these changes and updates. 

As well as helping to keep track of changes, 

Git was also designed to tackle some of 

the shortcomings of other version control systems. 

The benefits that Git offers 

over similar systems include, 

better speed and performance, reliability, 

free and open source axis, 

and an accessible syntax. 

It's also important to note that Git is 

used predominantly via the command line. 

Developers tend to find 

Git syntax and commands easy to learn. 

The other service commonly used by 

web developers is GitHub. 

GitHub is a Cloud-based hosting service that lets 

you manage Git repositories from a user interface. 

A Git repository is used to track 

all changes to files in a specific folder, 

and keep a history of all those changes. 

It incorporates Git version control features and 

extends these by providing its own features on top. 

Some of the most common of 

these features include access control, 

pull requests, and automation. 

You will learn more about these later in this course. 

The features are split out into 

different pricing models to suit 

different sized teams and organizations. 

It's also important to point out that 

GitHub is very popular among web developers. 

It's like a social network. 

For example, projects can be private or public. 

Users on GitHub have 

their own profile which other users can follow. 

Public projects can accept 

code contributions from anyone across the globe. 

It also includes multiple features 

outside of its core development tools like documentation, 

ticketing, and project features. 

You're now familiar with Git and GitHub 

version control systems along with 

the benefits and advantages that they offer. 

This is just the beginning of 

your version control journey 

with Git and GitHub. Great work.
