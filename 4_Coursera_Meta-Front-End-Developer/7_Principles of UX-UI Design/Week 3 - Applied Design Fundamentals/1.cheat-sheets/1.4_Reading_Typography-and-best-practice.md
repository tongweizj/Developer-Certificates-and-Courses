# 1.4_Reading_Typography-and-best-practice

Typography is crucial in our interactions with products and interfaces. More than 90% of online information is in text form. It enhances user experience and usability, capturing users' attention and potentially helping achieve business goals. Because there is some ambiguity in typographic terminology, this reading will go over the essential terms that are especially important to you as a UX UI designer.
版式对于我们与产品和界面的交互至关重要。 90%以上的在线信息都是文本形式。 它增强了用户体验和可用性，吸引用户的注意力并有可能帮助实现业务目标。 
由于排版术语存在一些含糊之处，因此本文将介绍对 UX UI 设计师来说特别重要的基本术语。

As a result, typography makes language visible and plays an essential role in design. Your Style Guide should also include a Typography study.
因此，排版使语言变得可见，并在设计中发挥着重要作用。 您的风格指南还应该包括版式研究。

## Lettering and typography

字体和版式

It's critical to distinguish between lettering and typography. Both are popular today and often mixed up. They do, in fact, deal with letterforms, but in different ways. Typography is the layout and arrangement of content using pre-made letter systems such as typefaces and fonts. Lettering, however, entails creating letterforms for a specific use and purpose.
区分字体和排版至关重要。 两者如今都很流行，但经常被混淆。 
事实上，他们确实处理字母形式，但方式不同。 
版式是使用预制字母系统（例如字体和字体）对内容进行布局和排列。 
然而，刻字需要为特定用途和目的创建字母形式。

## Typography terminology

版式术语

The term "typeface," also known as a font family, derives from physical print and refers to the faces of physical letter blocks. A typeface is made up of fonts, just like an album is made up of tracks or a book is made up of chapters. A typeface has multiple font weights and a consistent style across all characters, numbers, and symbols. Typefaces include Arial, Times New Roman and Comic Sans.
术语“字体”也称为字体系列，源自物理印刷，指的是物理字母块的表面。 字体由字体组成，就像专辑由曲目组成或书籍由章节组成一样。 字体具有多种字体粗细以及所有字符、数字和符号的一致样式。 字体包括 Arial、Times New Roman 和 Comic Sans。

## Typography elements

Before examining the best design practices for improving user experience, let us look at the typography elements. 

![Image of typography elements](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/PuIEEylxQG2iBBMpcUBt_A_978437b23bac4b8986eb42f540510ba1_Typography-elements.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=xgxK_suredzqMBeNtItoRWdBlMH-Y-ec93e9-v0ylBg)

### Baseline

The baseline is the point at which the text line rests. It calculates the distance between the written content and other elements on the interface.

### Cap height
瓶盖高度

The cap height of a typeface refers to the height of the capital letters. The cap height indicates the height of flat letters such as M, H, T, or I, as opposed to round letters such as S, O, or Q, or pointy letters such as A and V, which overshoot. It should be noted that the cap height is less than the typeface's maximum height.

字体的大写高度是指大写字母的高度。 大写字母高度表示 M、H、T 或 I 等扁平字母的高度，而不是 S、O 或 Q 等圆形字母或 A 和 V 等尖尖字母的高度，它们会超出。 应该注意的是，大写字母的高度小于字体的最大高度。

### X-Height

The X-height, also known as corpus size, is the distance between the lowercase "x baseline" and meanline. Because typefaces with very large x-heights have less white space between lines of type, this measure can be important for legibility. Because many letters have overshoots or rounded tops, measuring the top of flat characters like x, y, or z is easier, hence the name.

### Ascenders and descenders

An Ascender is a part of a letter that extends above the x-height or cap height, such as the stem of a lowercase b or d. Descenders are vertical downward strokes that extend beyond the baseline, such as the lowercase g or p.

### Weight

The overall thickness of a typeface's stroke is referred to as its weight. Weights can range from extremely light to extremely heavy. The most well-known weights are:

Light, 

Regular,

Medium, and 

Bold.

### Tracking 字距

Tracking is the spacing between all a font's characters. Properly chosen tracking can make the copy visually appealing. Letter spacing, also known as tracking, is the consistent adjustment of the space between letters in a piece of text.  
字距是字体所有字符之间的间距。 正确选择的跟踪可以使文案具有视觉吸引力。 字母间距，也称为跟踪，是对一段文本中字母之间的间距进行一致的调整。

## Kerning

字距调整

Kerning is the space that exists between two specific letters. It differs from tracking in that it does not apply to all characters. 
字距调整是两个特定字母之间存在的空格。 它与跟踪的不同之处在于它不适用于所有字符。

Leading
The space between two lines of text is known as leading.

White space
In typography, white space refers to the space between blocks of text. When used correctly, white spaces can make content more appealing and improve readability.

Stroke
A straight or curved line forms the main body of a letter. 

Serif
A stroke or foot-like element is connected to the end of the main strokes of some typefaces. Serif fonts are often more readable than sans-serif fonts because the tiny "feet" guide the reader's eyes to the next character. However, because of their small size, they may not always render properly on screens. 

Sans serif
A typeface that does not have any strokes or extra elements at the bottom of a letter. Because of the lower resolution of screens, sans serifs are frequently used for digital interfaces. As technology advances and screens with higher resolutions become more common, this may no longer be a deciding factor when selecting a font.

## How typography can be used to improve user experience

如何使用排版来改善用户体验

Because Typography contains so many elements, many designers overlook this discipline because mastering it takes time and practice. Remember that good typography is format-specific, and usability equals legibility. Let's go over a few key steps to ensure your next UI has legible typography that conveys the appropriate mood for your text.
由于版式包含如此多的元素，许多设计师忽视了这门学科，因为掌握它需要时间和练习。 请记住，好的排版是特定于格式的，可用性等于易读性。 让我们回顾几个关键步骤，以确保您的下一个 UI 具有清晰的排版，能够传达适当的文本情绪。

Hierarchy
The size of a text has a significant impact on the user's reading experience. Hierarchical elements should be used to separate the blocks and improve communication. The titles or headers, subtitles, and body text comprise a basic typography hierarchy. Because headings are at the top of the typographic hierarchy, they are larger and heavier.

Remember to start with a font size that is comfortable for your body text. As a general rule of thumb:

For desktops, use a font size of 16 points or higher for body text 

For iOS devices, use a text size of at least 11 point 

For Android devices, use at least 14 points for the main text 

Because different sizes of body text are common, choose typefaces that work well in different sizes.

Text colors
Color selection is also essential. Colors are associated with various emotions as well as a visual hierarchy. As a result, it is a good idea to use different colors for titles, body text, links, buttons and error messages. Also, remember that the text color must contrast with the background color; this is critical for a good reading experience, and even though it may seem obvious, there still are a lot of non-legible buttons out there.

Line length
Take note of the length of the text lines. Set a length limit so that it isn't too long and interferes with the reading experience. To determine the best line length for a text, use a simple formula based on font size: multiply it by 30. So, if your font size is 10px, the ideal reading line length is 300px.

Avoid text walls
You should avoid creating a "wall of text." A wall of text, also known as a gray wall effect, is a single block of text that is devoid of any white space or other design elements. By inserting paragraph breaks at appropriate intervals, you can avoid the gray wall effect. You can also use the following design elements: images, quotations, headings and subheadings and bullet points. When working with long paragraphs, try to include anything that isn't text and breaks up the solid block. 

Final thoughts
With these guidelines and typography know-how at your disposal, you're ready to start experimenting with typefaces, fonts, and styles in search of the ideal reading experience. However, one final caveat is that you could follow all of the above guidelines and still overlook some aspects of typography that an average user will notice immediately. As a result, the final stage of any text design iteration is comprehensive user testing.
