# 1.2_Reading_Layers-groups-and-frames

## Layers

Figma documents can become overly complex because they typically contain a dense combination of images, objects, and text. Designers are sometimes tempted to leave their layers panel looking like organized chaos, making it difficult to find things.
Figma 文档可能变得过于复杂，因为它们通常包含图像、对象和文本的密集组合。 设计师有时会想让他们的图层面板看起来像有组织的混乱，从而很难找到东西。

## Layer naming approaches

图层命名方法

When who, and to what extent we name our layers depends on the maturity of our design and the stage of the design process we're in (ideation, collaboration, ready for handoff).
何时由谁以及在多大程度上命名我们的层取决于我们设计的成熟度以及我们所处的设计过程的阶段（构思、协作、准备交接）。

## Conventions 惯例

Because every team is unique, the advice in this reading is just that - advice. Based on readability or how the developer team prefers to structure their components, you may develop your own methods of working. The person who names layers is also determined by the stage of your design process, the size of your team, and the level of involvement of your developers in the design process. To get you started, here are some methods: 

因为每个团队都是独一无二的，所以本文中的建议就是——建议。 
根据可读性或开发团队更喜欢构建其组件的方式，您可以开发自己的工作方法。 
命名层的人还取决于设计过程的阶段、团队的规模以及开发人员在设计过程中的参与程度。 
为了帮助您入门，这里有一些方法：

### The Task

Let's take the component below, for example:

![Card component containing a slice of lemon cake with a description](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Cml_TEssRuepf0xLLBbnuw_9a0336c54eb74791af2e698ef829e4a1_Card-component1.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=a4t8njvkpcMRnKkVU3XDTeA3MygXLbY8bRG_XGC5_gQ)

![List of what a simple card component contains](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6GgECXr4SjyoBAl6-Jo86A_b9a2750232c6414e9f6ac0729c2eaea1_Card-component2.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=BfM5qQLA7akRbaYWkMT-tWiFxTeABLb_a6-LhCmNThA)

### Design stage ideating

设计阶段构思

In this paradigm, there is no need to name layers because you are still in free-flow mode, generating ideas and focusing on solving the problem first.
在这个范例中，不需要命名层，因为您仍然处于自由流动模式，产生想法并首先专注于解决问题。

We're just having fun at this point, so we don't need to worry about layer naming or structure. The file creator does the naming for you. Because this is still very scrappy, don't worry about naming or even using specific elements (perhaps a rectangle will suffice for a button!).

### Refinement

细化

When you and your team are getting ready for approval from your key stakeholders, this is when you want to think about how easy it is for someone to digest your ideas and iterate on them, clear layer-naming greatly helps in this. 
当您和您的团队准备好获得主要利益相关者的批准时，您需要考虑别人消化您的想法并对其进行迭代有多么容易，清晰的层命名对此非常有帮助。

![Image of layer structure that is more refined](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ianBuaraQxWpwbmq2lMVrQ_9538826fd33047a6b00f6dba4b7e0fa1_Figma-layer-structure1.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=WjsntRFTG2WQpzPA4q92ynKfcOWrP4nLTRSiDI0kBzU)

Use descriptive layer names here. A card should be called a card, a number should be called a number, and a description should be called a description. At this point, you still own your designs but are brainstorming ideas with colleagues. This is an excellent time to name layers so that they make sense as a group. The simplest way to accomplish this is to be as descriptive as possible. 
此处使用描述性图层名称。 卡就叫卡，数字就叫数字，描述就叫描述。 
此时，您仍然拥有自己的设计，但正在与同事集思广益。 
这是命名图层的绝佳时机，以便它们作为一个组有意义。 
实现这一点的最简单方法是尽可能具有描述性。

## Groups and frames

When working with a large number of layers, you require a more formal method of bundling these. In other design software, you'd use a group for this, but Figma offers another option: frames. Frames appear to be very similar to Groups at first glance, so let's take a closer look and discover their unique characteristics. 

![Image of groups and frames in Figma](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/eyfYyoyCSrin2MqMgrq46Q_2dd5819299ef4bd5a5576a064753b4a1_groups-and-frames.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=v5hmgyMqcmb8Y-iRzTkh3XAEGCNplfVl3P1XJ7_tFJI)
  

Let's begin with the fundamentals. Every graphics app now has grouping functionality: select some objects, press Command G on a Mac or Ctrl G on Windows, and your layer list will now look cleaner with a collapsible group. Groups are defined by their contents. Your group's boundaries are the outer edges of whatever is inside it. As a result, whenever you change the position or dimensions of an object, the bounds of the group will change accordingly. The parent element in your document is related to the group object. The group's constraints are set to "left" and "Top" by default, as shown by the dashed lines here:

让我们从基础知识开始。 每个图形应用程序现在都具有分组功能：选择一些对象，在 Mac 上按 Command G 或在 Windows 上按 Ctrl G，您的图层列表现在将通过可折叠组看起来更干净。 
组由其内容定义。 
你的团队的边界是其内部的外部边缘。 
因此，每当您更改对象的位置或尺寸时，组的边界都会相应更改。 
文档中的父元素与组对象相关。 该组的约束默认设置为“左”和“上”，如此处的虚线所示：

![Image of group constraints in Figma](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JU7qSHoJQCyO6kh6CWAsbA_effb7813626248fc83fdb033043390a1_Group-constraints.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=LRh22dmo_klUHSCYTFQcsESL3JjmGXWuARFz0TaiIj8)

If the constraints are set to scale, your group will scale with its parent element. When you resize a group, the contents are always resized as well. You can keep the same aspect ratio by holding Shift while resizing. 
如果约束设置为缩放，您的组将随其父元素缩放。 当您调整组的大小时，内容的大小也会随之调整。 调整大小时按住 Shift 键可以保持相同的纵横比。

### Frames

At first glance, there does not appear to be much distinction between groups and frames. You select your objects and press Command G on a Mac or Ctrl-Alt-G on Windows to convert them into a frame. They will collapse similarly in the layer list. When you create a frame, the initial dimensions are determined by its contents. The boundaries of your frame, on the other hand, are independent of what's inside. 
乍一看，组和框架之间似乎没有太大区别。 您选择对象并按 Command G（Mac 上）或 Ctrl-Alt-G（Windows 上）将它们转换为框架。 它们将在图层列表中类似地折叠。 创建框架时，初始尺寸由其内容决定。 另一方面，框架的边界独立于内部的内容。

Your frame is similar to a window or, if you prefer, an artboard through which you can see the objects behind it. When you resize your frame, you are only resizing the window through which you are looking. Designing with frames is the key to unlocking Figma's most powerful features. You'll be able to create designs that are well-organized, beautifully styled, simple to use, scrollable and resizable. 
您的框架类似于一扇窗户，或者如果您愿意的话，类似于一个画板，通过它您可以看到其后面的对象。 当您调整框架大小时，您只是调整了您正在查看的窗口的大小。 使用框架进行设计是解锁 Figma 最强大功能的关键。 您将能够创建组织良好、样式精美、使用简单、可滚动和可调整大小的设计。

### Individual sizing

个人尺码

A frame's size is independent of its children, the nested layers. The size of the parent frame will not change if the children are moved or resized. This means that the parent frame can be the same size as or larger than its children. Allowing you to do things like internal add padding, create a "mask" effect, and enable scroll interaction in a prototype (examples of these below). In contrast to Groups, where the group must be the same size as its children. 

框架的大小与其子级（即嵌套层）无关。 如果子框架移动或调整大小，父框架的大小不会改变。 
这意味着父框架的大小可以与其子框架相同或更大。 允许您执行内部添加填充、创建“遮罩”效果以及在原型中启用滚动交互等操作（下面的示例）。 与组相反，组的大小必须与其子组的大小相同。

### Use styles

Frames, like rectangles, are objects that can be styled. They can be decorated with a fill, stroke, or shadow. They can also have rounded corners. With this level of adaptability, frames can be used to design almost anything. A button, for example, can be created using only a styled frame (blue with rounded corners) and a single text layer, unlike groups, where a second layer is required for the background (making auto layout impossible). 
框架与矩形一样，是可以设置样式的对象。 可以用填充、描边或阴影来装饰它们。 它们也可以具有圆角。 凭借这种程度的适应性，框架几乎可以用来设计任何东西。 
例如，可以仅使用样式框架（带有圆角的蓝色）和单个文本图层来创建按钮，这与组不同，后者需要第二层作为背景（使得自动布局不可能）。

### Overflow content

A frame's children (nested layers) can "overflow" past its bounds. With the help of "Clip Contents," those out-of-bounds children can be kept visible or hidden. 
框架的子级（嵌套层）可以“溢出”超过其边界。 在“剪辑内容”的帮助下，那些越界子项可以保持可见或隐藏。

### Resizing with constraints

Children of a frame can be applied to resizing constraints (nested layers). They are used to "constrict" or "pin" the children to the top, bottom, center, left or right of the frame or to scale as the size changes. 
框架的子级可应用于调整大小约束（嵌套层）。 它们用于将子项“收缩”或“固定”到框架的顶部、底部、中心、左侧或右侧，或者随着大小变化进行缩放。

### Auto-layout resizing

Auto-layout can be applied to frames to create a variety of (automatic) resizing behaviors. The direction a frame will grow, the spacing between children (nested layers), internal padding, and how each individual child will respond to changes are all determined by auto-layout. This is a very powerful feature that can be used in a variety of ways. 
自动布局可以应用于框架以创建各种（自动）调整大小行为。 
框架生长的方向、子项之间的间距（嵌套层）、内部填充以及每个子项对更改的响应方式均由自动布局决定。 这是一个非常强大的功能，可以通过多种方式使用。

### Layouts and grids

Grids and layouts can be applied to any frame, from a large device "artboard" to a UI region or a small component. These various frames can even be nested inside of another parent frame. When used with constraints, this is useful for maintaining consistent spacing across different container sizes and configuring resizing behavior. A desktop frame, for example, can have one layout for its nested page frame and another for its nested side navigation frame. Each has its resizing behavior.

## Make components

To create a component, all component layers must be housed in a single frame. However, if these elements are housed in a group, Figma will automatically convert the group into a frame when you click "create component." 

## Final thoughts

Reading about all of the features available with frames is useful, but hands-on learning is even better!
