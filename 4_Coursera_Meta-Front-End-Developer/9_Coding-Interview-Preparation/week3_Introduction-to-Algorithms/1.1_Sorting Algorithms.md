# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting a set of data might sound like a straightforward task given what you have already learned throughout this course.

However, it can be surprisingly challenging when you get into the details.

In this lesson you'll explore sorting algorithms and the different sorting methods that are available to you.

You'll be introduced to some of the various approaches to searching such as linear and binary.
鉴于您在本课程中已经学到的知识，对一组数据进行排序可能听起来是一项简单的任务。
然而，当你深入细节时，它可能会令人惊讶地具有挑战性。
在本课程中，您将探索排序算法和可用的不同排序方法。
您将了解一些不同的搜索方法，例如线性和二进制。

You'll also discover the steps involved in implementing both of these approaches and explore the advantages they offer.

You'll also learn about the steps required for implementing, Selection, Insertion, and Quicksort, and discover the strength and weaknesses of each sorting approach.

There are several algorithms that have been developed for this challenge and some data structures that had previously been discussed, like binary trees and heaps.

Both of these data structures have been designed with the aim of retaining the data in a sorted manner.
您还将发现实施这两种方法所涉及的步骤并探索它们提供的优势。
您还将了解实施选择、插入和快速排序所需的步骤，并发现每种排序方法的优点和缺点。
针对这一挑战开发了多种算法，以及之前讨论过的一些数据结构，例如二叉树和堆。
这两种数据结构的设计目的都是为了以排序的方式保留数据。

## consideration

Working with sorted data or having the ability to sort your own data can result in significant time savings.

Therefore, a data set of elements that can be ordered is fundamentally necessary.

This order could be alphabetically, sequentially, chronologically, by size of shape or by hue of color.

The actual metric that is used is less important than the fact that they can be arranged in an ascending or descending order.

使用排序数据或能够对自己的数据进行排序可以节省大量时间。
因此，一个可排序的元素数据集是根本上必要的。
该顺序可以是按字母顺序、顺序、时间顺序、形状大小或颜色色调。
使用的实际度量并不重要，重要的是它们可以按升序或降序排列。

A second consideration that's factored in is whether the ordering is permuted, meaning reordered, or has been accomplished by creating a copy whilst keeping the original list.
需要考虑的第二个因素是排序是否已排列（即重新排序），或者是否通过在保留原始列表的同时创建副本来完成。

## Selection sort

Selection sort is an early approach to sorting, it mimics how a human might approach the problem.

The underlying principle is very straightforward.

You start by searching through a list to identify the smallest element.
选择排序是一种早期的排序方法，它模仿人类处理问题的方式。
基本原理非常简单。
首先搜索列表以识别最小元素。

Then, switch this with the first element so the smallest element is placed at the top.

Now the previous occupant of the top spot has been switched into the vacated spot in the list.

This is repeated for every element in the list until the list has been ordered from the smallest through to the largest.

Let's explore this in an example.
然后，将其与第一个元素交换，以便将最小的元素放置在顶部。
现在，之前的榜首位置已被替换为列表中空出的位置。
对列表中的每个元素重复此操作，直到列表按从最小到最大的顺序排列。
让我们通过一个例子来探讨这一点。

【35， 46, 36, 9, 15, 6, 3】
You'll see in this diagram Element 35 at index location zero.

In a selection sort a comparison is made between the element at index zero and each element in the array until the lowest is found.

Equally, Element 46 in the next location is compared to each element and in this case switched with six.

Next is Element 36 found at Index 2.

You'll notice that Element 9 at Index 3 is deemed the smallest.

However the entire array must be searched.

This process is continued until every element is ordered by size.

Smallest to the left, largest to the right.

您将在此图中看到索引位置 0 处的元素 35。
在选择排序中，索引零处的元素与数组中的每个元素之间进行比较，直到找到最低的元素。
同样，下一个位置的元素 46 与每个元素进行比较，在本例中与 6 个元素交换。
接下来是在索引 2 处找到的元素 36。
您会注意到索引 3 处的元素 9 被视为最小的。
然而，必须搜索整个数组。
这个过程一直持续到每个元素都按大小排序。
左边最小，右边最大。

## insertion sort

Another straightforward approach to sorting is insertion sort.

Rather than searching through all the elements this approach begins by examining the first two elements in a list.
另一种直接的排序方法是插入排序。
该方法不是通过检查所有元素开始，而是首先检查列表中的前两个元素。
【4 ，1， 2， 3】

The smaller of the two is then moved to the front.
然后将两者中较小的一个移到前面。

【1 ，4， 2， 3】
This is repeated for every element each one being compared to the element on it's left a subsequent switch to the left is made if it's found to be smaller.
对每个元素重复此操作，每个元素都与其左侧的元素进行比较，如果发现较小，则随后切换到左侧。


Element 2 is compared with Element 4 is found to be smaller, so a swap happens.

Next, Element 2 is compared with Element 1 is found to be larger, so no more comparisons are made.

Then Element 3 is first compared with Element 4 is found to be smaller so a swap occurs.

Next, Element 3 is compared to Element 2, its larger so no further comparisons are made.

元素 2 与元素 4 进行比较，发现元素 2 更小，因此发生了交换。
接下来对比元素2发现元素1更大，所以不再进行比较。
然后首先将元素 3 与元素 4 进行比较，发现元素 3 较小，因此发生交换。
接下来，将元素 3 与元素 2 进行比较，元素 2 更大，因此不再进行进一步的比较。

Let's explore an example of this.
让我们探讨一个例子。

【35， 46, 36, 9, 15, 6, 3】
On screen you'll notice an array of numbers.

The first element 35 has nothing larger to the left so it remains where it is.

Then Element 46 is compared and is also left where it is.

Next you see Element 36, this is compared with Location 1, it's smaller than 46 so they're swapped.

Chase against location zero shows that no further swaps need a curve for this element.

At Step 3 you'll notice Element 9, this is compared with 46 and is therefore swapped to Location 2.

It is further compared with Location 0 and 1 and swapped again.

Next, the element found at Location 4 is compared with Location 3 and swapped.

It's further swapped with Location 2 and Location 1.

Is also compared with Location 0 but as it's greater no further movement is made.

The process is continued moving from right to left until the entire array is sorted.

Both the insertion and selection sort are straightforward approaches working on a simple paradigm.

在屏幕上您会注意到一系列数字。
第一个元素 35 的左侧没有更大的元素，因此它保持在原来的位置。
然后对元素 46 进行比较，也将其保留在原处。
接下来您会看到元素 36，它与位置 1 进行比较，它小于 46，因此它们被交换。
追踪位置零表明该元素不再需要曲线进行进一步交换。
在步骤 3 中，您会注意到元素 9，它与 46 进行比较，因此被交换到位置 2。
进一步与位置 0 和 1 进行比较并再次交换。
接下来，将在位置 4 找到的元素与位置 3 进行比较并交换。
它进一步与位置 2 和位置 1 交换。
还与位置 0 进行比较，但由于位置 0 更大，因此不再进行进一步的移动。
该过程继续从右向左移动，直到整个数组排序完毕。
插入排序和选择排序都是在简单范例上工作的直接方法。

## Quicksort

Quicksort is a more sophisticated approach that is more complex to implement.

However, it shows far greater efficiency.

Quicksort operates on the principle of pivots.

The algorithm selects an element in the array as the pivot.

Then all items in the array larger than this value are moved to the right of the pivot and all elements less than the value and move to the left.

This process is repeated for both sides of the pivot until all the items are sorted.
快速排序是一种更复杂的方法，实现起来也更复杂。
然而，它显示出更高的效率。
快速排序基于枢轴原理进行操作。
该算法选择数组中的一个元素作为主元。
然后，数组中大于该值的所有项目都将移动到枢轴的右侧，所有小于该值的元素将移动到左侧。
对枢轴的两侧重复此过程，直到所有项目都排序完毕。

【35, 46, 36, 9, 15, 6, 3】
Let's explore this in an example.

Here, Element 9 is selected as the pivot point.

Using Quicksort all items that are less than nine are swapped left and all items larger than nine swapped right.

Therefore, the smaller elements have now been moved left after this first split.

In this example these smaller elements are six and three.
让我们通过一个例子来探讨这一点。
这里，选择元素 9 作为枢轴点。
使用快速排序，所有小于 9 的项目都会向左交换，所有大于 9 的项目都会向右交换。
因此，在第一次分割之后，较小的元素现在已向左移动。
在此示例中，这些较小的元素是六个和三个。

【6, 3, 9，35, 46, 36, 15】
Applying the same procedure again to the resulting array terminates when three is found to be the only element not split.

Now taking the values that are greater than the original selected pivot you select a new pivot.

In this case 36 is selected and a further swapping of elements is performed.

Finally, the remaining unsorted index locations are swapped in relation to a new pivot.

Once all elements have been sorted the algorithm terminates.




当发现 3 是唯一未拆分的元素时，再次对结果数组应用相同的过程就会终止。

现在，采用大于原始选定枢轴的值，您可以选择一个新枢轴。

在这种情况下，选择 36 并执行元素的进一步交换。

最后，剩余的未排序索引位置相对于新的主元进行交换。

一旦所有元素都已排序，算法就会终止。
There are many additional sorting approaches that can be used with some approaches even forming hybrids of these existing ones.

In practice you probably would not write your own implementations as there are excellent implementations in every language.

The goal here is to show how they operate under the hood so that you can choose the best one when faced with a given problem.

As with data structures there is not one sorting algorithm that provides the best result in every given scenario.

Each approach has its trade-offs and is more effective in some environments than others.

You will learn more about the efficiency of these approaches when compared to Big-O notation soon.

In this video you've explored sorting algorithms and the different sorting methods that are available to you.

You've also learned about the steps required for implementing Selection, Insertion and Quicksort and discovered the strengths and weaknesses of each sorting approach.
