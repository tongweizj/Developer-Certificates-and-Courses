In a previous video, you learned about the divide and conquer paradigm.

In this video, you're going to learn about recursions and how to implement the requirements for recursive solution.

One of the basic tenets of any given language is its ability to perform loops.

Loops enable us to perform actions repeatedly until the desired output is achieved.

Unlike humans, computers never tire of performing the same mundane task repeatedly.

An alternative approach to solving a problem than a loop is recursion.

The practice of having functions call themselves is referred to as recursion and the focus of this video.

Recursion is when a function calls itself with a smaller instance of a problem repeatedly until some exit condition is met.

What is required for recursion? There are three requirements for implementing a recursive solution, namely the base case, the diminishing structure, and the recursive call.

Let's look at an example relating to binary to better illustrate these three requirements.

Consider a challenge where you are tasked with finding the exponent of a number.

Recall that calculating an exponent of a number is to determine how many potential permutations can be derived from it.

This was discussed when demonstrating how binary can be used to represent a range of characters.

The base case ensures that the function will not continue to call itself and eventually ends.

Line 1 outlines a function that will take two arguments, x and n.

The base case is if n equals 0.

In this instance, the program will terminate.

Line 4 is the second part of the conditional statement.

If a termination point has not been reached, call the function again with a reduced structure.

In this instance, the goal is to multiply x by n to find the total number of potential states that could exist for the binary number.

Reducing the input value is as important as establishing a base case.

This way, the function will eventually reach the base case and cease to call itself.

The third component of a recursive function is to include a call to itself.

This happens on Line 5, where the exponent is accepting the diminished structure.

The structure can be said to be diminished because the size has been reduced from one core to another.

Each time the function is called, a new instance is created on the call stack.

Calling the above function with x equals 2 and n equals 3 will result in three instances being created and placed on the call stack.

This increases computational cost as resources are required to make a function call.

However, the computation from each result will be retained on the call stack.

This can be useful when computing hierarchical problems or problems where one can benefit from knowing which steps resulted in a given outcome like traversing a graph.

Let's explore an example of the use of recursion.

Consider the video on binary search.

A binary search function will accept an argument of a list and a target value.

First, the middle point of the list is checked against the elements to determine which half of the list to check.

This process is repeated until the target element is found or deemed to be not there.

You might consider solving this problem through a loop or recursively.

The input to the recursion would be a list and a search element, and the recursive function will call itself until the target endpoint is reached.

Why then use recursion when a simple loop will do? Some problems lend themselves well to recursive calls.

Consider calculating the Fibonacci of a given number.

Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers where the first two numbers are zero and one and every other number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the set.

Calculating the result involves passing a number, calculating the output, changing the number, then calling the function again with a new integer input.

Writing the code this way means that you can simply call the function with a different integer and it will return a breakdown of the required steps.

Readability is a strong plus for recursion.

Sometimes when a problem requires many checks, a loop can quickly become unwieldy.

Recursive solutions reduce the amount of code required to solve a problem and can be easier to read and understand.

Finally, one would employ a recursive approach as part of a divide and conquer solution.

Here, the problem is broken into smaller steps and repeated to come upon the optimum solution.

In this video, recursion has been introduced.

You have learned that while recursion can add some computation overheads to a problem, it can also result in eloquent, easily read code.

Additionally, that recursion epitomizes a divide and conquer solution, breaking the problem into its smallest components, and solving those.
在之前的视频中，您了解了分而治之的范例。在本视频中，您将了解递归以及如何实现递归解决方案的要求。任何给定语言的基本原则之一是其执行循环的能力。循环使我们能够重复执行操作，直到达到所需的输出。与人类不同，计算机永远不会厌倦重复执行相同的平凡任务。除了循环之外，解决问题的另一种方法是递归。让函数调用自身的做法称为递归，也是本视频的重点。递归是指函数用问题的较小实例重复调用自身，直到满足某些退出条件。递归需要什么？实现递归解决方案需要三个要求，即基本情况、递减结构和递归调用。让我们看一个与二进制相关的示例，以更好地说明这三个要求。考虑一个挑战，您的任务是找到一个数字的指数。回想一下，计算数字的指数是为了确定可以从中导出多少种潜在的排列。在演示如何使用二进制来表示一系列字符时对此进行了讨论。基本情况确保函数不会继续调用自身并最终结束。第 1 行概述了一个带有两个参数 x 和 n 的函数。基本情况是 n 等于 0。在这种情况下，程序将终止。第 4 行是条件语句的第二部分。如果尚未到达终止点，则使用简化的结构再次调用该函数。 在本例中，目标是将 x 乘以 n 来找到二进制数可能存在的潜在状态总数。减少输入值与建立基本案例同样重要。这样，函数最终将到达基本情况并停止调用自身。递归函数的第三个组成部分是包含对其自身的调用。这发生在第 5 行，其中指数接受减结构。结构可以说是缩小了，因为尺寸从一个核心到另一个核心都缩小了。每次调用该函数时，都会在调用堆栈上创建一个新实例。使用 x 等于 2 且 n 等于 3 调用上述函数将导致创建三个实例并将其放置在调用堆栈上。这会增加计算成本，因为进行函数调用需要资源。但是，每个结果的计算将保留在调用堆栈上。当计算分层问题或问题时，这非常有用，在这些问题中，人们可以从了解哪些步骤导致给定结果（例如遍历图形）中受益。让我们探讨一下使用递归的示例。考虑二分搜索的视频。二分搜索函数将接受列表和目标值的参数。首先，对照元素检查列表的中间点以确定要检查列表的哪一半。重复此过程，直到找到目标元素或认为目标元素不存在。您可以考虑通过循环或递归来解决这个问题。递归的输入将是一个列表和一个搜索元素，递归函数将调用自身，直到到达目标端点。既然一个简单的循环就可以了，为什么还要使用递归呢？有些问题很适合递归调用。 考虑计算给定数字的斐波那契数列。斐波那契是一个数字序列，其中前两个数字是 0 和 1，其他每个数字都是该集合中前两个数字的总和。计算结果涉及传递一个数字、计算输出、更改数字，然后使用新的整数输入再次调用该函数。以这种方式编写代码意味着您可以简单地使用不同的整数调用该函数，它将返回所需步骤的细分。可读性是递归的一大优势。有时，当一个问题需要多次检查时，循环很快就会变得难以处理。递归解决方案减少了解决问题所需的代码量，并且更易于阅读和理解。最后，人们将采用递归方法作为分而治之解决方案的一部分。在这里，问题被分解为更小的步骤并重复以得出最佳解决方案。在这个视频中，介绍了递归。您已经了解到，虽然递归会给问题增加一些计算开销，但它也可以生成雄辩且易于阅读的代码。此外，该递归体现了分而治之的解决方案，将问题分解为最小的组件，然后解决它们。
