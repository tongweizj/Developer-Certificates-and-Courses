# Interview tips

## Introduction

In this reading, you will learn how to prepare for an interview and get some essential tips about presenting yourself in person and at virtual interviews.

Before successfully starting a job at a company, you must demonstrate that you are a suitable candidate for the role. Getting a job can be challenging and may require attending several interviews before finding a position suited to your skill set. Ideally, you are looking for one where you are the strongest candidate for the role. It is essential to realize that even if you are well-suited to a position, there is always the possibility that a more experienced candidate is also being interviewed. So, even though you did not get a role, you could still have had a good interview. 

It may help to think about interviews as a stepping stone on your journey to a rewarding full-time career. Regardless of the outcome, always ask yourself, did I present myself to the best of my ability? And, can I learn things from this interview that can help me in subsequent interviews?

在本文中，您将学习如何准备面试，并获得一些有关在现场和虚拟面试中展示自己的基本技巧。
在成功在公司开始工作之前，您必须证明您是该职位的合适人选。
找工作可能具有挑战性，可能需要参加多次面试才能找到适合您技能的职位。
理想情况下，您正在寻找最适合您的职位候选人。
重要的是要认识到，即使您非常适合某个职位，也总是有可能面试更有经验的候选人。
所以，即使你没有得到一个角色，你仍然可以得到一个很好的面试。

将面试视为您通往有价值的全职职业生涯的垫脚石可能会有所帮助。
无论结果如何，总是问自己，我是否尽了最大的努力？
而且，我能从这次面试中学到一些对我后续面试有帮助的东西吗？

## Prepare

Here are some of the standard questions that you may encounter in any given interview:

-   Tell me about yourself.
    
-   Why do you feel that they should hire you?
    
-   What are your major strengths?
    
-   Or, what are your major weaknesses?
    
-   What pay are you expecting?
    
-   How do your previous experiences make you suitable for this role?
    
-   What do your friends say about you?
    
-   Why do you want this role?
    
-   How have you dealt with conflict in the past?
-   说说你自己。
    
- 为什么你觉得他们应该雇用你？
    
- 你的主要优势是什么？
    
- 或者，你的主要弱点是什么？
    
- 你期望的薪水是多少？
    
- 您之前的经历如何让您适合这个角色？
    
- 你的朋友对你有何评价？
    
- 你为什么想要这个角色？
    
- 过去你是如何处理冲突的？

Knowing these questions are coming is advantageous because you can prepare for them. After reading this list, can you write a concise answer for each? You will find the answers to many of these questions in your resumé. A good tactic is to review your resumé before an interview to see which aspects are related to the company and role. 

Additional answers worth preparing for may relate to the company itself. Where is the company based, and what do they do? How does your previous employment overlap with their current needs? Research the same role in other companies. Know the market salary for the position if you are asked about a pay rate. The interviewer will know the answer, so being able to answer this successfully demonstrates your preparedness. Learning about a company displays an eagerness to work there. Finally, consider that a weakness may also be a strength. "I focus excessively on details" can be damaging if there are tight deadlines; however, it is a strength if the job requires meticulous attention to detail.

知道这些问题即将到来是有利的，因为您可以为它们做好准备。
读完这个列表后，你能为每个问题写出一个简洁的答案吗？
您可以在简历中找到其中许多问题的答案。
一个好的策略是在面试前查看您的简历，看看哪些方面与公司和职位相关。

其他值得准备的答案可能与公司本身有关。
公司总部在哪里，做什么？
您以前的工作与他们当前的需求有何重叠？
研究其他公司中的相同角色。
如果您被问及薪资水平，请了解该职位的市场薪资。
面试官会知道答案，因此能够成功回答这个问题表明您已做好准备。
了解一家公司表明了对该公司工作的渴望。
最后，考虑一下弱点也可能是优点。
如果期限紧迫，“我过度关注细节”可能会造成损害；
然而，如果工作需要一丝不苟地关注细节，那么它就是一种优势。

## Soft skills

Conflict resolution is an essential soft skill to possess. Invariably in your working life, you will encounter a situation where your approach or goals do not align with those of a colleague, employer, or customer. Managing these situations helps create a harmonious working environment. Be cognizant of when you have clashed with people and how you resolved it. Did you find this approach to be successful? If not, then do some research on how to deal with conflict in the workplace.
解决冲突是一项重要的软技能。 在您的工作生活中，您总是会遇到您的方法或目标与同事、雇主或客户不一致的情况。
管理这些情况有助于创造和谐的工作环境。
了解您何时与人发生冲突以及如何解决。
您认为这种方法成功吗？ 如果没有，那就研究一下如何处理工作场所的冲突。

## Presentation

It's frequently said, "dress for the job you want, not the job you have." How you present yourself can subconsciously convey much information about you. Be neat and respectable. Your future work colleagues may be on the panel, and you want to make a good impression. The attire you wear should be suitable for the role. Pride in appearance can be equated with pride in a role. 
人们常说：“为你想要的工作着装，而不是为你拥有的工作着装。”
你如何展现自己可以潜意识地传达很多关于你的信息。
保持整洁和受人尊敬。
您未来的工作同事可能会出现在小组中，您希望给人留下好印象。
您所穿的服装应该适合该角色
对外表的自豪感可以等同于对角色的自豪感。

## Demeanor

Display readiness for the role. Colleagues will want to see someone interested in being there. Be calm and relaxed when answering questions. It is never a good policy to interrupt a question. Listen until the question is finished, and take a breath. Competency questions require a STAR answer (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Display pride in previous work-related experiences you've had. And have some questions prepared. In an interview, the interviewer should always allow you to ask them a question. Take this time to learn something about what is being sought. What conditions might be more favorable for you? Are the company's goals aligned with yours, and can you convey that? 

Be authentic in your actions. It is better to be truthful and honest when applying for a post. Exaggeration may lead to a follow-up interview, but it is better to be capable of any position you intend to work in.

表现出对该角色的准备。
同事们会希望见到有兴趣在那里的人。
回答问题时要冷静、放松。
打断问题从来都不是一个好策略。
听直到问题结束，然后呼吸。
能力问题需要 STAR 答案（情况、任务、行动、结果）。
对您之前的工作相关经历表现出自豪感。
并准备一些问题。 在面试中，面试官应该始终允许你问他们问题。
花点时间了解一下正在寻求的东西。
哪些条件可能对您更有利？
公司的目标与您的目标一致吗？
您能传达这一点吗？

行动要真实。 申请职位时最好诚实、诚实。
夸张可能会导致后续面试，但最好能够胜任你打算从事的任何职位。

## Virtual interviews 

Many interviews are conducted virtually. Virtual interviews are challenging as it can be more difficult to read body language over video.

确保您的所有技术都能正常工作。

花一些时间确保您穿着得体。
即使您没有进过办公室，也要穿得像进过办公室一样。
与面对面面试一样，请注意您的肢体语言。 坐直并集中注意力。 尽管您可能在家中，但保持工作礼仪仍然很重要。
