# 2.2_What type of interviews might you expect

## Introduction

Getting a job involves jumping through several hoops. After compiling your resumé, identifying a few suitable job opportunities, filling in applications and researching companies, you will begin to receive interview offers. The aim of an interview is to find a good match between the company and the candidate. Every company is different, and every company will conduct the interview process in its own way. 
找工作需要经历几个环节。 整理好简历、确定一些合适的工作机会、填写申请表并研究公司后，您将开始收到面试机会。 面试的目的是找到公司和候选人之间的良好匹配。 每个公司都是不同的，每个公司都会以自己的方式进行面试过程。

- 在线作业可能包含哪些内容。
- 技术面试的详细信息。
- 以及您可能需要完成的任何带回家的作业。

## Screening

The first contact you will have with a company will be a screening interview. A recruiter, having read your application, will usually arrange a phone call to discuss potential suitability. This stage aims to determine if you are genuinely interested in the role and whether you would be a good fit for the company. It is an excellent opportunity for you, as a candidate, to learn more about the role, the company and their hiring process. Some great questions to ask might include the following:
您与公司的第一次接触将是筛选面试。 招聘人员在阅读您的申请后，通常会安排电话讨论潜在的适合性。 此阶段的目的是确定您是否真正对该职位感兴趣以及您是否适合该公司。 
对于作为候选人的您来说，这是一个了解该职位、公司及其招聘流程的绝佳机会。 
一些重要的问题可能包括以下内容：

-   What is the role?    
-   What coding language does the company typically use?
-   What is the interview process, what types of interviews will be conducted, and how many will there be?
-   What is the nature of the project the proposed role is for?
-   What is the typical makeup of the team?
-   Who will be on the interview panel, and what is their role in the company?


Remember that the interviewer wants to give you the opportunity to make a compelling case about why you should be hired. They should be more than willing to provide you with any information that might help you better prepare.

From the company perspective, the screening will typically look at your soft or interpersonal skills. There will be no technical questions, and a Human Resources (HR) representative will typically conduct it. Presenting yourself well and demonstrating your social abilities, like listening and question-answering, is essential. 
从公司的角度来看，筛选通常会考察你的软技能或人际交往能力。 不会有任何技术问题，通常由人力资源 (HR) 代表来进行。 良好地展示自己并展示您的社交能力（例如倾听和回答问题）至关重要。

## Quiz

A quiz is a very straightforward way of establishing if a candidate knows how to code. Typically, they are conducted early in the interview process and act as a filter to reduce the number of interviews a company must conduct. You should not expect deep or extended questions; instead, the purpose is to determine whether the candidate has a good grasp of the basics. Some questions could include the following:
测验是确定候选人是否知道如何编码的一种非常简单的方法。 通常，它们在面试过程的早期进行，并充当过滤器，以减少公司必须进行的面试次数。 你不应该期待深入或扩展的问题； 相反，目的是确定候选人是否很好地掌握了基础知识。 一些问题可能包括以下内容：

-   How do you test for nulls in an array in a language of your choice?
-   What is the space complexity for Quicksort?
-   Which data structure would you use to store a list of keys and values?
-   What is a collision in hashing?
-   What is the syntax to select a column name using SQL?
-   What testing processes are you familiar with?
- 如何使用您选择的语言测试数组中的空值？
- 快速排序的空间复杂度是多少？
- 您将使用哪种数据结构来存储键和值的列表？
- 什么是哈希冲突？
- 使用 SQL 选择列名的语法是什么？
- 您熟悉哪些测试流程？

The questions will be job-specific, so the content may vary. However, they will be questions that should be answered with concise, direct responses. When preparing for an interview, it is prudent to identify which programming languages the company uses and any other technical insights that can be gleaned from the job posting and initial screening.
问题将针对具体工作，因此内容可能会有所不同。 然而，这些问题应该用简洁、直接的回答来回答。 在准备面试时，应谨慎确定公司使用哪些编程语言以及可以从职位发布和初步筛选中收集到的任何其他技术见解。
## Online coding assignment

You may be asked to complete an online coding assignment, depending on the job you apply for. This generally happens before a technical interview, as the results can be used as a point of discussion during subsequent interviews. However, the assignment could also occur after a successful technical interview to compare candidates.
根据您申请的工作，您可能会被要求完成在线编码作业。 这通常发生在技术面试之前，因为结果可以作为后续面试中的讨论点。 但是，也可以在成功进行技术面试以比较候选人之后进行分配。

This step allows you to approach and solve a clearly defined task in a non-pressurized environment. Similar in difficulty level to the quiz, it is a filtering step to ensure that you can work with the target technology and grasp the basics, like loops, Booleans, checks, and so on. Some coding assignments could be timed; in this situation, you would have access to Google and other reference material.
此步骤允许您在非压力环境中处理并解决明确定义的任务。 难度级别与测验类似，这是一个过滤步骤，以确保您能够使用目标技术并掌握基础知识，例如循环、布尔运算、检查等。 有些编码作业可以定时； 在这种情况下，您可以访问 Google 和其他参考资料。

## The technical interview

This is also called the coding challenge. Typically, this will happen after the initial screening. It can either be virtual or in-person. The interviewer will present you with a challenging problem and give you a brief period to solve it. It is always best to discuss your thoughts aloud as you engage with the challenge. For example, before deciding between two data structures, explain why you feel one is more appropriate than the other for the task. Take the opportunity to demonstrate your general understanding of the topic and the task-specific expertise.
这也称为编码挑战。 通常，这会在初步筛选后发生。 它可以是虚拟的，也可以是面对面的。 面试官会向你提出一个具有挑战性的问题，并给你一个简短的时间来解决它。 当您应对挑战时，最好大声讨论您的想法。 例如，在两种数据结构之间做出决定之前，请解释为什么您认为一种数据结构比另一种更适合该任务。 借此机会展示您对该主题的总体理解和特定任务的专业知识。

The difficulty level of the technical interview should be low. Interviewers know that you don't have access to Google and may have had to memorize some of the required syntax. Instead, these interviews are designed to demonstrate your problem-solving skills. Some technical interviews may be conducted using pseudocode. Additionally, technical interviews allow future colleagues to assess your ability to reason with code. They often include short, specialized prompts like:
技术面试的难度应该较低。 面试官知道你无法访问 Google，并且可能必须记住一些必需的语法。 相反，这些面试旨在展示您解决问题的能力。 一些技术面试可能会使用伪代码进行。 此外，技术面试可以让未来的同事评估你用代码进行推理的能力。 它们通常包括简短的专门提示，例如：

-   How would you explain technology X to a non-technical person?
-   What is your favorite technology and why?
-   What databases have you worked with?
-   Tell me about a technical challenge you have overcome in a project.
-   What projects have you worked on in your spare time?


These are generic prompts, and a technical interview will be tailored for a specific role. However, preparing a few answers describing your journey as a programmer is good practice. Review your projects and be clear on the various decisions you have made and why particularly when selecting one technology over another.

## The take-home assignment

If you get this far, you are doing very well. This may happen before or after the technical interview, as the interviewers may want to discuss your thought process around the solution you provided earlier in the process. If there are many rounds of interviews for the post, then it may happen between two technical interviews. A company should not ask you to do a take-home assignment unless they feel you are potentially a good fit.
如果你能走到这一步，那么你就做得很好了。 这可能发生在技术面试之前或之后，因为面试官可能想围绕您在流程早期提供的解决方案讨论您的思维过程。 如果该职位有很多轮面试，那么可能会发生在两次技术面试之间。 公司不应该要求你做带回家的作业，除非他们认为你可能很适合。

You will be given several days to expand on a solution to the challenge. You could be asked to build an application or programmatically solve a traffic routing problem. Other tasks might be project specific, such as, if you are going to work with vision processing, you may be asked to demonstrate that you can automatically detect objects in a video feed.
您将有几天时间来扩展应对挑战的解决方案。 您可能会被要求构建一个应用程序或以编程方式解决流量路由问题。 其他任务可能是特定于项目的，例如，如果您要使用视觉处理，可能会要求您证明您可以自动检测视频源中的对象。

## Top tips

Conduct your research before every interview and review each one on completion. Most companies are happy to provide feedback after your interview, so always ask for this and use the points made as a starting point to be better prepared for the following interview. Remember, practice makes perfect.
在每次采访之前进行研究，并在完成后审查每一次采访。 大多数公司都很乐意在面试后提供反馈，因此请务必询问并以提出的观点为起点，为接下来的面试做好更好的准备。 请记住，熟能生巧。

Several types of interviews have been explained. However, the company you are applying to will have its preferred format, which could take one or more of these approaches. The most important takeaway is that “every interview is a learning process.” Suppose you missed a question or were queried on a technical concept you aren't familiar with. In that case, the opportunity is there for you to learn more about it post-interview.
已经解释了几种类型的访谈。 但是，您要申请的公司将有其首选的格式，可以采用其中一种或多种方法。 最重要的一点是“每次面试都是一个学习过程”。 假设您错过了一个问题或被询问了您不熟悉的技术概念。 在这种情况下，您有机会在面试后了解更多信息。
