# 2.1_what is a coding interview?

A technical interview is where you demonstrate your competency to code.

Normally, you would have completed a screening core and demonstrated that your soft skills are suitable for the company.
通常，您会完成核心筛选并证明您的软技能适合公司。

Soft skills relate to your ability to conduct yourself socially.
软技能与您的社交能力有关。

This includes communicating clearly, having a good work ethic, and that your presentation aligns with the company values.
这包括清晰的沟通、良好的职业道德以及您的演讲符合公司价值观。

The technical interview is to determine that you are technically capable of the responsibilities of the role.
技术面试是为了确定您在技术上是否有能力胜任该职位的职责。

In this video, you will learn how to approach the technical interview, when going for coding interview, it will help you to keep the following steps in mind; prepare to succeed, solve the problem conceptually first, employ appropriate tools, and lastly, optimize the solution.
在本视频中，您将学习如何进行技术面试，在进行编码面试时，它将帮助您牢记以下步骤；
为成功做好准备，
首先从概念上解决问题，
采用适当的工具，
最后优化解决方案。

Doing a deep dive into these concepts will help you understand how to apply the method.

## Firstly, prepare to succeed.

Many candidates might feel some trepidation`惶恐不安` at doing a technical interview.

What happens if a question is asked and my mind blanks? 
Fortunately, there are steps that you can take to prepare for success.

Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.
Solve the problem conceptually first.

Before employing a solution, it is a good idea to first have a clear picture of the question and what the answer will look like.

Take some time to ensure that you are clear on what is being asked.

An interviewer will have no issue with you seeking clarification from the onset.
面试官不会对你从一开始就寻求澄清提出异议。

If there is a whiteboard, then use it, jot down the major points of the problem before outlining a potential solution.
先记下问题的要点，然后概述潜在的解决方案

Here is an excellent opportunity to show your ability to reason a problem using pseudocode before writing a single line of code.
这是一个绝佳的机会，可以展示您在编写一行代码之前使用伪代码推理问题的能力。

Demonstrating your ability to reason out a problem is halfway to it.
展示你推理解决问题的能力就成功了一半。

Remember, one can always be taught to code and ability for problem-solving is a much sought-after ability.
请记住，一个人总是可以被教导如何编码，而解决问题的能力是一种备受追捧的能力。

Be vocal as you assess the problem and show the interviewers how you engage with problem-solving and why you elected one approach over another.
在评估问题时要直言不讳，并向面试官展示您如何解决问题以及为什么选择一种方法而不是另一种方法。

It can be a big help if you can equate the problem with one you already know.
如果您能将这个问题与您已经知道的问题等同起来，这会很有帮助。

Later in the course, there is a video on the practice of divide and conquer.
在课程的后面，有一个关于分割问题，解决问题的视频。
This is a good opportunity to employ that.
这是一个利用它的好机会。

Breaking the problem into smaller ones can help to solve a seemingly complex problem.

If there is an additional time constraint and do exceed the allowed time, you will still be able to show functional chunks of code.
如果有额外的时间限制并且确实超出了允许的时间，您仍然可以展示功能性的代码块。

## Employ appropriate tools.

The types of problems presented in a coding interview will have to be completed during the interview time thus, the solutions will not be excessively complicated in nature.
编码面试中提出的问题类型必须在面试期间完成，因此解决方案本质上不会过于复杂。

They are designed to test your problem-solving ability on a microcosmic level and your awareness of the available tools.
它们旨在测试您在微观层面上解决问题的能力以及您对可用工具的认识。

Consider the classical count the socks problem.
考虑经典的数袜子问题。

You are given an array that represents sock colors.
给你一个代表袜子颜色的数组。

Yellow socks are represented by one, blue socks by two, red socks by three, green socks by four, and lastly, orange socks by five.
1 = 黄色袜子
2 = 蓝色袜子
3 = 红色袜子
4 = 绿色袜子
5 = 橙色袜子

Sock colors equal the numbers as explained, namely 1,2,2,1,1,3,5,1,4, and 4.

Determine how many pairs of the same color socks exist?

- There are four 1's which equates to two pairs of yellow socks, three and five represent odd socks.
- Although it is a red and orange sock, they don't have matching socks to form pairs.
- There are two 2's and two 4's, which each represent a pair of blue and green socks.

To solve this problem succinctly, you can utilize an appropriate data structure.

Later in this course, you will review data structures.

One video outlines how a dictionary stores key value pairs.

A solution would be to use the sock colors as keys and the count as values then iterate over the dictionary and retrieve all odd numbers, which indicates the presence of any odd socks.

While there are many programmatic ways of solving this, the use of existing structures minimizes the code required and demonstrates familiarity with fundamental building blocks.

When possible, always utilize existing approaches rather than attempting to implement manual solutions.
如果可能，请始终利用现有方法，而不是尝试实施手动解决方案。

In addition to familiarizing yourself with staple structures, review common sorting and searching algorithms before engaging in any technical interviews.
除了熟悉主要结构之外，在参加任何技术面试之前还要回顾常见的排序和搜索算法。

It is good practice to optimize your code.
优化代码是一个很好的做法。

That means writing or rewriting code, so a program uses the least possible memory or disk space and minimize the CPU time or network bandwidth.

Coding the solution is a good step towards a respectable solution.

Ensure you make time to optimize your code.

Another concept you'll meet in this course is time and space complexity.
您将在本课程中遇到的另一个概念是时间和空间复杂性。
Can you demonstrate to the interviewer that you understand these crucial concepts`关键概念`? Put simply, it is a way of measuring how fast and how much space your solution will take.

When presenting your answer, outline your solution's time and space complexity and then see if you can improve.

Identify any repeat or overlapping code.

Demonstrate that you can modularize this code into a function that is callable repeatedly and reuse code when possible.


An often repeated principle for good programming is dry.

## Don't repeat yourself.

It is the idea to only say a thing once in code and reuse as often as needed.

Additionally, if there are portions of your code that are no longer required as a result of modularizing or as a result of an avenue of thought that was not completed, remove it.

Avoid excessive compiler calls.

If you were searching for a value in an array, terminate the loop when the item is found.

A very achievable optimization on your code is to include a return statement when a value is found or to use a loop that is dependent on a Boolean.

As soon as a result is found, the loop can be terminated.
一旦找到结果，就可以终止循环。

This increases overall efficiency and reduces time complexity.

Space complexity is all about being clever with memory usage.

Whenever you can, avoid creating more variables than needed.

In this video, you learned about some approaches that can be used regardless of the challenge presented.

Even if you're not familiar with the problem or don't achieve result in the time allotted, always strive to demonstrate your reasoning and best-practice approaches.

Prepare for technical interviews by doing practice solutions to online problems and when possible employ a similar methodology to each challenge so that regardless of the challenge faced, you're working from a comfortable framework.

A coding interview can appear like a daunting task.

There will always be elements of the unknown involved and your desire to succeed may add some pre-interview nerves.

Just stay calm and think logically.

Good luck.
