# 3.5_Time complexity

When developing applications or evaluating efficiency, it is always useful to have a metric or a lens through which you can evaluate fitness for function.

Evaluation in Computer Science will often consider two aspects namely time and space.

In this video, you will learn how to evaluate time efficiency or gauge performance by the time taken to complete a task.

在开发应用程序或评估效率时，拥有一个可以评估功能适合度的指标或镜片总是有用的。
计算机科学的评估通常会考虑两个方面，即时间和空间。
在本视频中，您将学习如何通过完成任务所需的时间来评估时间效率或衡量绩效。

You can refer to this as the time complexity of a task.

An application must return information within an acceptable time frame.

These days, people expect an instantaneous response when clicking on a website.

您可以将其称为任务的时间复杂度。
应用程序必须在可接受的时间范围内返回信息。
如今，人们期望在点击网站时立即得到响应。

There might however, be some extra scope afforded to more complex queries depending on the user's needs and expectations.

Big-O notation is a metric for determining an algorithms efficiency but simply it gives an estimate of how long it takes your code to run on different sets of inputs.

In this video, the amount of time an algorithm will take is considered.

然而，根据用户的需求和期望，可能会为更复杂的查询提供一些额外的范围。
Big-O 表示法是一种用于确定算法效率的指标，但它只是给出了代码在不同输入集上运行所需时间的估计。
在此视频中，考虑了算法所需的时间。

Some of the Big-O notations you will encounter include the following O of one, O of log log n, O of log n, O of n and so on.

So how do you measure the quickest possible time that something can be computed? You make use of a constant time algorithm where it takes O of one time to compute.

您将遇到的一些 Big-O 表示法包括以下 O of 1、O of log log n、O of log n、O of n 等等。
那么如何衡量计算某件事的最快时间呢？ 
您使用一种恒定时间算法，其中计算时间为 O。

## O(1)

But simply it means that no matter what is entered into a system, it will only take one computation.

A simple example to illustrate this is to consider printing the first item in an array.

但简单来说，这意味着无论输入什么内容到系统中，都只需要一次计算。
说明这一点的一个简单示例是考虑打印数组中的第一项。

In this instance, no matter how many values exist in the array the approach has a Big-O of one.
在这种情况下，无论数组中存在多少个值，该方法的 Big-O 都为 1。

## O(n)

Things can get more complex if you need to do a search.

Consider that you have an array of ten items and you wish to know if a certain value is in this array, you might apply a loop and check each item to see if the value exists.

In this example, the complexity is said to be O of n.

This is called linear time.

如果您需要进行搜索，事情可能会变得更加复杂。
假设您有一个包含 10 个项目的数组，并且您希望知道该数组中是否存在某个值，您可以应用一个循环并检查每个项目以查看该值是否存在。
在此示例中，复杂度为 O of n。
这称为线性时间。

The search is going to be equal to the length of the array passed.

The larger the array, the more time is required to search it.

So, if in place of ten items, you have 100 items, then the search will take ten times as long.

搜索将等于传递的数组的长度。
数组越大，搜索所需的时间就越多。
因此，如果您有 100 个项目代替 10 个项目，那么搜索时间将是原来的十倍。

Let's explore an example, each operation comes at a time price for time complexity.

So, O of one means it costs one single computation and O of n means it costs n computations.

For example, you wouldn't say it takes 45 seconds.
让我们探讨一个例子，每个操作都有一个时间复杂度的时间代价。
因此，O of 1 意味着它需要一次计算，而 O of n 意味着它需要 n 次计算。
例如，您不会说需要 45 秒。

You would say the complexity is n.

So for every n action, that is plus one on our final result of complexity.

If n = 100, it is 100 checks.

The complexity is still O to n.

Only n means it is ten times longer.

This means that your application speed depends on the size of the data being processed.

Print array at position n is an example of an O to one operation.

That means print the dock at whatever n is.

It doesn't matter how big n is.

The cost is always one.

你会说复杂度是n。
因此，对于每一个 n 动作，我们的最终复杂度结果都会加一。
如果 n = 100，则为 100 次检查。
复杂度仍然是O到n。
只有n意味着它长十倍。
这意味着您的应用程序速度取决于正在处理的数据的大小。
位置 n 处的打印数组是 O 到 1 操作的示例。
这意味着无论 n 是什么，都打印码头。
n 有多大并不重要。
成本永远是一。

## O(log n)

Let's continue to O of log n.

This search is less intensive than O to n but worse than O to one, O of log n is a logarithmic search.

So it will increase as new inputs are added but these inputs only offer marginal increases.

A good example of this in action is a binary search.

Imagine you are playing a guessing game with the following prompts too high, too low, correct.

Given a range of 100 to one, you may decide to approach the problems systematically.

让我们继续到 log n 的 O。
这种搜索强度不如 O 到 n 但比 O 到 1 更差，O of log n 是对数搜索。
因此，随着新投入的添加，它会增加，但这些投入仅提供边际增长。
一个很好的例子是二分搜索。
想象一下你正在玩一个猜谜游戏，下面的提示是太高、太低、正确。

给定 100 比 1 的范围，您可能会决定系统地解决问题。

First you guess 50 and it is too high, then you guess 25 and it is still too high.

You then decide to go 12 or 13.

It is still too high.

What is happening here is that you are having the search space with each guess.

So while the input to this function was 100 using a binary search approach, you should come upon the answer in under six or seven guesses.

This solution would be said to have a time complexity of O log n.

Even if n, the range of numbers entered, is made ten times bigger.

It will not take ten times as many guesses.

首先你猜50，它太高了，然后你猜25，它仍然太高。
然后您决定选择 12 或 13。
它仍然太高了。
这里发生的情况是，每次猜测都有搜索空间。
因此，虽然使用二分搜索方法对该函数的输入是 100，但您应该在六到七次猜测中找到答案。
该解决方案的时间复杂度为 O log n。
即使输入的数字范围 n 增大十倍。
不需要十倍的猜测。

## O(n^2)

Let's move on to O n squared.

O n squared is heavy on computation.

This is a quadratic complexity, meaning that the work is doubled for every element in the array.

A good way to visualize this is to consider that you have an array of arrays.

The first loop will equal the number of elements inputted, namely n.

The second loop would also look at the number of input elements n.

So, the overall complexity of running this approach can be said to be n times n, which is n squared.

## graph displays the algorithm

So, how will you visually represent the problem? This graph displays the algorithm for time complexity, the x axis relates to the number of inputs and the y axis relates to the time taken.

Notice that as the number of inputs increases, it has a different impact on the gradient of the line for all cases but O of one.

In this graphical representation of how n relates to the number of computations taken, the best time to aim for is O to one.

O of log n is still very good.

O to n is acceptable and O n square is not great.

Of course it is not always possible to tell how long an approach is going to take.

Let's return to the example of looking for something in a loop.

While you could say that to search a loop takes O to n time, this might not always be the case.

Consider that the item being searched for is the first in array, then the return will be in O one time.

Pretty good.

Equally, the element might be missing.

So every item must be searched O n time.

The middle case would be that it is found around the middle of the loop O of n over two.

When evaluating an approach, there are three definitions used, best case, worst case and average case.

To conclude in this video, the notion of time in relation to complexity was introduced, you have been given something to consider when implementing a solution to a problem.

A good question to ask yourself before you start, is how many computations does my solution employ? And is there a better way? Now that you use a metric to evaluate your solution to a given problem, you can start thinking of its efficiency in relation to time complexity.

This is not the only way to consider a solution and in the next video, the focus will be placed on space complexity.
