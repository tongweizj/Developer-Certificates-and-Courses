# Module summary

Well done.

You've reached the end of the introduction to the coding interview module.

Let's take a few moments to review what you learned during this module.

You began the module with a course introduction where you were informed of the content of the coding interview prep course.

You then moved on to the coding interview lesson.

Your first lesson focused on the technical coding interview, primarily to determine that you are technically capable of the roles, responsibilities.

You learned about the steps that you must keep in mind when this interview is conducted.

You were taught that using the appropriate tools is always important, and that you have to keep time constraints in mind.

You then learned about code optimization and should be able to write or rewrite code so a program uses the least possible memory or disk space and minimize the CPU time or network bandwidth.

To summarize, you learned about some approaches that can be used regardless of the challenge presented.

Even if you're not familiar with the problem or don't achieve a result in the time allotted always strive to demonstrate your reasoning and best-practice approaches.

Prepare for technical interviews by practicing solutions to online problems and when possible, employ a similar methodology to each challenge.

This will assist you in the future so that regardless of the challenge faced, you're working from a comfortable framework.

You then focused on communication and the importance of first impressions.

You were introduced to verbal and nonverbal communication and the importance of both.

You learned about the star method and how to use it to your benefit when communicating with interviewers.

You should now be able to look at the context of a situation and the challenges faced responsibilities around the tasks involved, the actions required to address the challenges and lastly, the outcomes that need to be achieved.

To summarize, you should now be able to clearly convey a concept during an interview.

Communicate why you are suitable for the role in a verbal and nonverbal manner.

Finally, use the star method for engaging with technical questions that will arise over the course of an interview.

You then moved on to the next lesson where you were introduced to computer science.

You started with binary, where you learned about the difference between base 10 and base 2.

You then discovered positional notation.

This is the use of the position of the number to denote a progressive increase in value.

You were then introduced to how a computer stores data as bytes and that each byte is made up of eight bits that can either be one or zero.

You were also given some examples.

You've examined the concept of exponentiation or counting the power of a number.

This was followed with examples where a lock with a different number of digits was used to explain the concept.

You should now be able to apply this knowledge and understand that binary is the language of computers.

Next, you explored memory.

The first concept you learned about was memory capacity, which refers to the number of bytes that a computer can hold.

You also learned about the different types of memory that need to be considered namely cache memory, main memory, and secondary memory.

You should know by now that to better understand the various layers of memory, it is important to pause and consider how a computer works.

You learned about the transfer rate or the speed at which a computer can transfer memory into the cache for processing.

You then explored cache and secondary memory and should be able to describe the differences.

You were then introduced to the concept that a computer's main memory consists of read access memory RAM and Read Only Memory ROM.

You should be able to describe the role of the main memory and distinguish between RAM and ROM.

You should now be better positioned to work with memory.

You then moved on to explore time complexity, where you learned how to evaluate time efficiency or gauge performance by the time taken to complete a task.

You discovered Big-0 notation, which is a metric for determining an algorithm's efficiency.

Thus, it gives an estimate of how long it takes your code to run on different sets of inputs.

Or it considers the amounts of time an algorithm will take.

You were given some examples and should have a solid idea of how to measure time complexity.

You then learned about space complexity.

It is not just the speed of an algorithm that is important, but also how much memory will a given solution take.

To understand space complexity, you were introduced to the concept of auxiliary space, which is the space required to hold all data required for the solution also referred to the temporary space needed to compute a given solution.

The other concept was input space, which referred to the space required to add data to the function, algorithm, application or system that you are evaluating.

To summarize, space complexity equals input space plus auxiliary space.

That is the space required to compute a result.

You have done some quizzes and all the topics mentioned.

That's a great start to your learning journey in this course and all this content should empower you to have excellent coding interviews in the future.
