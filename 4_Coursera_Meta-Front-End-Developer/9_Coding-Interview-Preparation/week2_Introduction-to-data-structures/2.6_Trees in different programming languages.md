# Trees in different programming languages

In this reading, you will learn about some of the differences in the implementation of trees in different programming languages.

A tree is an abstract data type (ADT) that is present in many languages. As discussed in other readings, an ADT is a blueprint for how a data structure will manifest. It relates to the restraints and requirements placed on a data structure to ensure that it will always operate in the same way. This can be very useful for programmers who are switching between multiple programming languages as it provides clear expectations of how a data structure will operate. 

The key fundamental principles of a tree are that it contains a number of nodes, a root node and a selection of leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are unconnected nodes at the base of a tree. A root node is always at the top, and every value descends from this one node. A tree will always be arranged in some form of hierarchy. 

在本文中，您将了解不同编程语言中树的实现的一些差异。
树是一种抽象数据类型 (ADT)，存在于许多语言中。 正如其他读物中所讨论的，ADT 是数据结构如何体现的蓝图。 它涉及对数据结构的限制和要求，以确保它始终以相同的方式运行。 这对于在多种编程语言之间切换的程序员非常有用，因为它提供了对数据结构如何运行的明确期望。

树的关键基本原理是它包含多个节点、一个根节点和一组叶节点。 叶节点是树底部未连接的节点。 根节点始终位于顶部，每个值都从该节点下降。 一棵树总是以某种形式的层次结构排列。
## Implementing a tree 
实现一棵树

There are many types of trees; perhaps the most straightforward and common one is a binary tree. A binary tree has the following properties: 

1.  Every node has a maximum of two child nodes.
    
2.  Every node must have a key so that it can be easily identified.
    
3.  Values found to be less than the node are placed in the left child node, and values that are greater are placed in the right child node.
    

树木有很多种； 也许最直接和最常见的是二叉树。 二叉树具有以下性质：
1. 每个节点最多有两个子节点。
2. 每个节点必须有一个密钥，以便于识别。
3. 发现小于该节点的值放入左子节点，大于的值放入右子节点。

To create a tree, one must ensure that there is a root (starting node) and a method for determining the subsequent nodes. Each node must contain a reference to the left and right nodes so that the tree can be traversed. This can be achieved by creating a class with these three attributes (key, location of left node, location of right node). This class will need three additional methods so that it can function as a tree. These include: 
要创建一棵树，必须确保有一个根（起始节点）和一种确定后续节点的方法。 每个节点必须包含对左节点和右节点的引用，以便可以遍历树。 这可以通过创建一个具有这三个属性（键、左节点位置、右节点位置）的类来实现。 该类需要三个附加方法才能充当树。 这些包括：

1.  A lookup method: It is important that the tree can be queried for the existence or absence of information. 
    
2.  Insertion method: As has already been noted, inserting a node on a tree involves finding out where it should go and placing it on the left side of the nearest higher value. 
    
3.  Removal method: This method will need to remove an item from a tree. This operation poses additional challenges when applied to a tree due to the connected nature of a tree. Consider that a tree comprises a series of connected nodes. So, removing one carelessly can result in destroying the connections in a tree. Therefore, when implementing this method, in addition to removing the node, it is necessary to check all the children nodes and ensure that a new connection is made with the node of the next highest value. 
1. 查找方法：重要的是可以查询树是否存在信息。
2.插入方法：正如已经指出的，在树上插入一个节点涉及到找出它应该去哪里并将其放置在最近的较高值的左侧。  
3. 删除方法：此方法需要从树中删除一个项目。 由于树的连接性质，当应用于树时，此操作会带来额外的挑战。 考虑一棵树由一系列连接的节点组成。 因此，不小心删除一个可能会导致破坏树中的连接。 因此，在实现该方法时，除了删除该节点外，还需要检查所有子节点，并确保与下一个最高值的节点建立新的连接。
## Searching in trees 

The approach outlined above for coding a tree is applicable to all the languages covered in this course. There are no concrete implementations of trees, which means that to use them, you are required to implement the code yourself. Another feature that is worth bearing in mind is how a search is performed on a tree. One can code a solution that applies a depth-first search or a breadth-first search. To better understand this concept, consider how the tree is organized. Each level has a parent node that connects to two child nodes. These child nodes, in turn, have two of their own child nodes. A breadth-first search is one that will examine each node on the same level before stepping into a deeper level. This can be pictured as scanning all nodes horizontally before checking the next level. A depth-first search will examine each node on a branch until the end node is reached before checking the adjacent branch. This can be pictured as a vertical scanning of the tree. 
上面概述的树编码方法适用于本课程涵盖的所有语言。 
树没有具体的实现，这意味着要使用它们，您需要自己实现代码。 
另一个值得记住的功能是如何在树上执行搜索。 人们可以编写应用深度优先搜索或广度优先搜索的解决方案。 
为了更好地理解这个概念，请考虑树是如何组织的。 每个级别都有一个连接到两个子节点的父节点。 这些子节点又具有两个自己的子节点。 
广度优先搜索是在进入更深层次之前检查同一级别上的每个节点的搜索。 
这可以想象为在检查下一个级别之前水平扫描所有节点。 
深度优先搜索将检查分支上的每个节点，直到到达结束节点，然后再检查相邻分支。 
这可以被描述为对树的垂直扫描。
## Conclusion

This reading covered the topic of trees and how they appear in different programming languages. Because trees are an abstract data type, there is no built-in method for the languages used in this course. To implement a tree, it is crucial to keep in mind the important characteristics of a tree so that you can correctly implement them.
