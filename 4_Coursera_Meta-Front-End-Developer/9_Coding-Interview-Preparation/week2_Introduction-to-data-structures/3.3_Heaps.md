## 堆的结构和功能
So let's get started with heaps.

A heap is a specialized data structure that is modeled **like a tree** but behaves in a similar way to a queue though with a notable difference of assigning priority to some elements.

Each element in a heap has a key value and the priority can either be the smallest or the largest key value.

Heaps that place priority on the lowest valued key are called min heaps and ones that place the priority on the maximum value are called max heaps.

Heaps were first introduced as a means of storing and searching data efficiently.

But since then it has been recognized that there are a number of very useful operations that a heap can be applied to.
那么让我们从堆开始吧。

堆是一种专门的数据结构，其建模方式类似于树，但其行为方式与队列类似，但在为某些元素分配优先级方面存在显着差异。
堆中的每个元素都有一个键值，优先级可以是最小的或最大的键值。
将优先级放在最低值键上的堆称为最小堆，将优先级放在最大值上的堆称为最大堆。
堆最初是作为一种有效存储和搜索数据的方法而引入的。
但从那时起，人们就认识到堆可以应用于许多非常有用的操作。

### 功能
A heap has a few select core operations that it can perform.
堆有一些可以执行的选择核心操作。

min-heap
- Insert
- find_min
- delete_min 

max heap
- insert, 
- find_max 
- delete_max 

For the rest of this video, the discussion will revolve around min heaps but you can reverse everything said and it will apply to a max heap.

The only difference between the two is where the priority is placed, as with many of the data structures discussed on this course.

These methods are the fundamental elements that constitute a heap.

Different implementations in different languages could have additional methods added.
对于本视频的其余部分，讨论将围绕最小堆展开，但您可以颠倒所有内容，它将适用于最大堆。
两者之间的唯一区别在于优先级的放置位置，就像本课程中讨论的许多数据结构一样。
这些方法是构成堆的基本元素。
不同语言的不同实现可以添加额外的方法。

An instance of which may be decreased key this is where the value of a key is changed.

The motivation for which would lie with the priority of the key in real-world instance changes.

When discussing trees it was mentioned that binary trees sought values in order of size.

If the value is less than the node go down the left path, if the value is greater than the node go down the right path.

Because of this underlying architecture, heaps are often built using binary trees though another approach would be to make an array act in a way that mimics the behavior of a binary tree.
其实例可能是减少键，这是更改键的值的地方。
其动机在于现实世界实例变化中键的优先级。
在讨论树时，有人提到二叉树按大小顺序寻求值。
如果该值小于该节点，则沿着左侧路径走；如果该值大于该节点，则沿着右侧路径走。
由于这种底层架构，堆通常是使用二叉树构建的，尽管另一种方法是让数组以模仿二叉树行为的方式运行。

The minimum value is placed on the root node and each subsequent value is placed on the hierarchy where their value dictates.

This means that to retrieve the minimum value from a heap is O of one because it will be stored always at the root.

Unlike a stack, retrieving a value does not cause it to be moved from the tree.

Instead, a delete_min method exists that can be called if the intent is to remove items as they are processed.

Typically a heap would not support operations such as deleting items other than the priority element.

The reason being that a heap is built for specialized purpose, that involves identifying the most important item and returning this in the shortest time possible.

Then queuing up the next item of importance.

Deleting items in the tree would require restructuring the tree and this would lead to a degradation in performance.

If you are looking for a data structure that can act in this way, then you might consider structures other than a heap.

insertion into a min-heap is done through propagation.

Each item is inserted at the root, a comparison is then made with the left value.

If this is less than the newly inserted item, they are swapped, this continues until the newly inserted item has no greater value above it and the value below is lower.
最小值放置在根节点上，每个后续值放置在其值指示的层次结构上。
这意味着从堆中检索最小值的时间复杂度为 1，因为它将始终存储在根中。
与堆栈不同，检索值不会导致它从树中移动。
相反，如果意图在处理项目时删除项目，则可以调用 delete_min 方法。
通常，堆不支持诸如删除优先级元素以外的项目之类的操作。
原因是堆是为了特殊目的而构建的，这涉及到识别最重要的项目并在尽可能短的时间内返回它。
然后排队下一个重要的项目。
删除树中的项目需要重组树，这会导致性能下降。
如果您正在寻找可以以这种方式运行的数据结构，那么您可能会考虑堆以外的结构。

Insertion in a heap can be achieved in O of log n time.

Having examined the underlying mechanisms that power heap, you may now have some idea of how this data structure can be applied.

Considering that its inherent structure prioritizes a particular value from a group of elements, the natural application would be for scheduling.

This can apply to CPUs routers or packet handling.

Additionally, one could imagine that such a structure would be useful in prioritizing certain tasks like interview scheduling where the key used to store the candidate may relate to what stage of the interview process they lie at or what priority the role has within the organization.

Having a process that automatically applies schedules based on importance can be a huge time saving device.

In this video, you have gained a greater understanding of heaps and how they can be used to organize elements from least to most important.

You have been shown that by limiting functionality, productivity can be increased.

As with the selection of any data structure, it is important to find the right tool for the right job.



插入最小堆是通过传播完成的。
每个项目都插入到根部，然后与左侧值进行比较。
如果这小于新插入的项目，则它们被交换，这种情况持续到新插入的项目没有比它更高的值并且比它更低的值。
在堆中插入可以在 O of log n 时间内完成。
检查了堆的底层机制后，您现在可能对如何应用此数据结构有所了解。
考虑到其固有结构优先考虑一组元素中的特定值，自然的应用将用于调度。

这可以应用于 CPU 路由器或数据包处理。
此外，人们可以想象，这样的结构对于确定某些任务的优先级非常有用，例如面试安排，其中用于存储候选人的密钥可能与他们处于面试过程的哪个阶段或该角色在组织中的优先级有关。

拥有一个根据重要性自动应用计划的流程可以节省大量时间。

在本视频中，您对堆以及如何使用堆按照从最不重要到最重要的顺序组织元素有了更深入的了解。

我们已经向您展示，通过限制功能，可以提高生产力。

与选择任何数据结构一样，为正确的工作找到正确的工具非常重要。
