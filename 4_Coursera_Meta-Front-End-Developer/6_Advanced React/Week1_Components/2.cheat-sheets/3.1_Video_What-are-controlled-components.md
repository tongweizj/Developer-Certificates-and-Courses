# 2.1_Video_What are controlled components?

When browsing the Internet, there's a big chance that you'll land on a form, even without you realizing it.

From simple email inputs and subscribing to newsletters, to more complex forms such as creating an account on your favorite social media platform , forums are everywhere.

You'll probably find yourself implementing`实施` them in your applications regularly.

In this video, you'll learn the concept of **controlled components** in React and how they are used in foreign processes.

The fundamental `基本的` concepts of HTML forms and how forums can be created as React components.

When it comes to React applications, HTML forms work differently to other DOM elements.

You may recall that the DOM is a logical tree-like structure representing the HTML document, and it uses nodes to describe the various parts of the document.

Traditional HTML forms keep some internal state inside the DOM and have some default behavior when submitting them.

That's normally done via the action attribute, which points to the endpoint that will handle the request.

But what if you would like a more granular `粒状` level of control? For example, customers of the little lemon restaurant can reserve a table on the website using a form.

Imagine if there was a function that could handle the submission of the form and access the data that the user entered into it.

That's where controlled components come in.

Controlled components are a set of components that offer a declarative application programming interface or API to enable full control of the state of form elements at any point in time using React state.
受控组件是一组组件，它们提供声明性应用程序编程接口或 API，以便使用 React 状态在任何时间点完全控制表单元素的状态。

Rather than relying on the native state from DOM elements, the React state is made the single source of truth, controlling the displayed value of your form elements at all times.
React 状态不依赖于 DOM 元素的本机状态，而是成为单一事实来源，始终控制表单元素的显示值。

The way you perform this state delegation is via the value prop.
你执行此状态委派的方式是通过值属性。

Value is a special property, the React added to most of the form elements to determine the input content at any point in time during the render life cycle.
值是一种特殊属性，React添加到大多数表单元素中，以在渲染生命周期的任何时刻确定输入内容。

In order to create a controlled component, you need to use a combination of local state and the value prop.
为了创建一个受控组件，你需要使用本地状态和值属性的组合。

Initially, you will assign the local stage to the value property.
最初，你将本地状态分配给值属性。

But how do you get updates from any new text character entered in the input? Well for that, you need a second prop to complete the design of your controlled component, the onChange callback.
但是，如何获取输入中输入的任何新文本字符的更新呢？嗯，为此，你需要第二个属性来完成你的受控组件的设计，即onChange回调。

The onChange callback receives an event parameter, which is an event object representing the action that just took place similar to events on DOM elements.
onChange回调接收一个事件参数，它是一个表示刚刚发生的操作的事件对象，类似于DOM元素上的事件。

To get the new value from every keystroke, you need to access the target property from the event and grab the value from that object, which is a string.
要从每次按键中获取新值，你需要从事件中访问目标属性，并从该对象中获取值，这是一个字符串。

Finally, to have control over the form values whenever the form is submitted, you can use the onSubmit prop in the form HTML element.

最后，为了在提交表单时控制表单值，你可以在表单HTML元素中使用onSubmit属性。

The onSubmit callback also receives a DOM-like event as a parameter.
onSubmit回调也接收一个类似DOM的事件作为参数。


There you can access your form values to perform any desired logic that must take place before submission, for example validating your input values.
在这里，你可以访问你的表单值，执行在提交之前必须发生的任何所需逻辑，例如验证输入值。


Also, if you would like to prevent the default HTML form behavior, you need to call event.preventDefault inside your onSubmit callback.
此外，如果你想阻止默认的HTML表单行为，你需要在onSubmit回调中调用event.preventDefault。

Well, there you have it.
好了，就是这样。

You have discovered a technique called controlled components that enables react to be the source of truth for the state of your form inputs.
你已经发现了一种称为受控组件的技术，它使React成为表单输入状态的真实来源。

React offers controlled versions of the majority of input types and recommends using controlled components for the implementation of forums.
React提供了大多数输入类型的受控版本，并建议在实现表单时使用受控组件。

However, keep in mind that there's still some form elements that remain uncontrolled similar to their DOM counterparts.
但是，请记住，仍然有一些表单元素保持不受控制，类似于它们的DOM对应物。

As you move forward with your learning, you will gain more insight into both controlled and uncontrolled form elements.
随着你的学习的深入，你将更深入地了解受控和不受控表单元素的知识。

In this video, you have learned about the concept of controlled components and React and how they are used in foreign processes.
