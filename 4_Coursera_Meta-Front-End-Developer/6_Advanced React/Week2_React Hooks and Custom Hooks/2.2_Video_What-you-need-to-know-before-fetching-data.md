# 2.2_Video_What you need to know before fetching data

The Fetch function is a very useful tool, but there are some important things that you need to understand before you start using them.

Initially, it's good to get an overview of how JavaScript delegates duties so that you can gain insight into how the Fetch function contributes to this process.

In this video, you will learn how the Fetch function works to retrieve data from the web and how to provide an example in plain JavaScript of the process.

Fetch is used to make a server requests to retrieve some JSON data from it.

Fetch API is a set of functionalities that we have at our disposal to use in JavaScript to make such a server request.

## single-threaded execution

It's a bit like a clerk at the post office.
这有点像邮局的职员。
Say you're bringing a package to the post office and you're the first in the queue.
假设您要带一个包裹去邮局，并且您是队列中的第一个。
The clerk on the other side of the service desk is JavaScript.
服务台另一边的店员是JavaScript。

Since they can only do one thing at a time.
因为他们一次只能做一件事。
They go through the process of getting your details, measuring the weight of the package, pasting stamps onto the package, charging you for the service, and go into the back-office and carrying the package there, then taking time to find the correct place for the package before it gets shipped.
他们会完成以下过程：获取您的详细信息，测量包裹的重量，在包裹上贴邮票，向您收取服务费用，然后进入后台并将包裹运送到那里，然后花时间找到正确的地点 在发货前检查包裹。

The problem with this approach is that the next step cannot start before the previous one is finished.
这种方法的问题是，在前一步完成之前，下一步无法开始。

That's what's known as **single-threaded execution**.
这就是所谓的**单线程执行**。

Since JavaScript is not at all equipped to multitask, a way to go around this issue is as follows.
由于 JavaScript 根本不具备多任务能力，因此解决此问题的方法如下。

First, JavaScript gets your details.
首先，JavaScript 获取您的详细信息。
At the same time, it calls a clerk to measure the weight of the package.
同时，它还叫来店员测量包裹的重量。

Then JavaScript calls yet another clerk to paste some stamps onto the package.
然后 JavaScript 调用另一个职员将一些邮票粘贴到包裹上。

Javascript calls yet another clerk to charge you for the service, and yet another clerk is called to carry the package to the back-office, allowing JavaScript to take care of the next customer.
Javascript 会呼叫另一名店员向您收取服务费用，然后又叫另一名店员将包裹运送到后台，从而让 JavaScript 能够照顾下一位客户。

Essentially, this delegation of duties is what's referred to as asynchronous JavaScript.
本质上，这种职责委托就是所谓的异步 JavaScript。

In this metaphor, you can think of the browser as the post office, Javascript as one clerk in the post office and all these other clerks can be referred to as browser APIs or web APIs.
在这个比喻中，您可以将浏览器视为邮局，Javascript 视为邮局的一名职员，所有其他职员都可以称为浏览器 API 或 Web API。

Now let's explore a practical example of how this delegation of duties works in JavaScript.
现在让我们探讨一个实际示例，了解 JavaScript 中的职责委派如何工作。

I have a local HTML file.

The most important part of this file is the script tag, which is getting some JavaScript code from the file named script.js located in the same folder as this HTML file.
该文件最重要的部分是 script 标记，它从与该 HTML 文件位于同一文件夹中的名为 script.js 的文件中获取一些 JavaScript 代码。

I'm serving these files locally using the live server VS Code extension.
我使用实时服务器 VS Code 扩展在本地提供这些文件。

Let me inspect this HTML file in the browser.
让我在浏览器中检查这个 HTML 文件。

Currently it only shows H_1 heading that reads fetching data.
目前它只显示读取数据的H_1标题。

Now, let me take a step back and let's say the JavaScript, the post office worker, needs to get some user data from the computer database.
现在，让我退后一步，假设 JavaScript（邮局工作人员）需要从计算机数据库中获取一些用户数据。

Here is the JavaScript code inside the link to script.js file.
以下是 script.js 文件链接内的 JavaScript 代码。
What do you expect the output of this code will be since JavaScript can only do one single thing at any given time.
由于 JavaScript 在任何给定时间只能做一件事，因此您期望这段代码的输出是什么。
Well, let's explore what the code is doing step-by-step.
好吧，让我们逐步探索一下代码在做什么。
On Line 1, it performs a console log for the words another customer approaching.
在第 1 行，它执行控制台记录“另一位客户正在接近”的字样。

Then it contacts the Fetch API, which is a browser API that is external and separate from JavaScript.

Rather than waiting for the Fetch API to return the information, it keeps on executing the code that comes after it, outputting the texts that begins our valued customer.

In the meantime, the Fetch API requests some user data from a third party web-based API available at the random user dot.me Website.

The fetch function is what's known as a facade function.

Meaning it's a function that looks like it's part of JavaScript, but actually it is just a way for me to call a browser API from JavaScript.

In other words, it's a way for me to access a piece of browser functionality that's outside of JavaScript.

You can think of it as the JavaScript post office clerk calling the records department of the post office to get some data about a customer.

When the other clerk gets back with the information and hands it over to the post office clerk, then they will get a JSON representation, and finally, we'll log that data to the console.

That means that the sequence of console logs from the code will be as follows.

An initial console log that outputs another customer approaching a second console log that outputs our valued customer please wait a moment while I get some information back from the records department, and a final console log that outputs the data.

I will now execute this code to confirm that describe the behavior.

Everything is already saved.

All I need to have this code executed is to go back to the browser, right-click on the page and press the reload command to refresh it.

You can achieve the same result by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard.

Now, I first get another customer approaching then the our valued customer.

Finally, the result of the call to the third party API.

This is how JavaScript, although being single-threaded, can perform asynchronous operations.

In this video, you learned how the Fetch function works to retrieve data from the web and how to provide an example in plain JavaScript of the process.

You should be familiar with this concept before fetching data in React, which I'll explore soon.






然后它联系 Fetch API，这是一个外部且独立于 JavaScript 的浏览器 API。

它不会等待 Fetch API 返回信息，而是继续执行后面的代码，输出开始我们尊贵客户的文本。

与此同时，Fetch API 会从随机用户 dot.me 网站上提供的基于 Web 的第三方 API 请求一些用户数据。

fetch 函数就是所谓的外观函数。

这意味着它是一个看起来像是 JavaScript 一部分的函数，但实际上它只是我从 JavaScript 调用浏览器 API 的一种方式。

换句话说，这是我访问 JavaScript 之外的浏览器功能的一种方式。

您可以将其视为 JavaScript 邮局职员致电邮局的记录部门以获取有关客户的一些数据。

当其他职员返回信息并将其交给邮局职员时，他们将获得 JSON 表示形式，最后，我们将该数据记录到控制台。

这意味着代码中的控制台日志的顺序如下。

初始控制台日志输出另一个客户接近，第二个控制台日志输出我们尊贵的客户，请稍等，我从记录部门获取一些信息，以及输出数据的最终控制台日志。

我现在将执行此代码来确认描述的行为。

一切都已经保存了。

执行此代码所需要做的就是返回浏览器，右键单击页面并按重新加载命令刷新它。

按键盘上的 F5 键可以获得相同的结果。

现在，我首先让另一位客户接近，然后是我们尊贵的客户。

最后是调用第三方API的结果。

这就是 JavaScript 虽然是单线程的，但却可以执行异步操作的方式。

在本视频中，您了解了 Fetch 函数如何从 Web 检索数据以及如何以纯 JavaScript 提供该过程的示例。

在 React 中获取数据之前，您应该熟悉这个概念，我很快就会对此进行探讨。
