# 3.2_Video_Writing the first test for your form

Imagine that The Little Lemon Restaurant started receiving a few bad reviews from its customers.

The problem is that they could not figure out what was wrong and act accordingly.

Since users only provided a low numerical score, skipping the part of providing additional feedback and passing that information to the chefs.

In order to solve that, they've decided to make the common text box mandatory as long as the score provided by their users is lower than five in a scale to ten.

Additionally, they would like to shield this new logic with automated tests so whenever any changes are performed, the test suite would run and be able to catch any potential errors incurred by a faulty update.
此外，他们希望通过自动化测试来屏蔽这个新逻辑，因此每当执行任何更改时，测试套件都会运行并能够捕获由错误更新引起的任何潜在错误。

So the application consists of a feedback form that contains a range input for a numerical score ranging from zero to ten and a text box to incorporate additional comments.
因此，该应用程序由一个反馈表单组成，其中包含从零到十的数字分数的范围输入和一个用于包含其他评论的文本框。

To satisfy the requirements desired by Little Lemon, the submit button will be disabled if the score is lower than five, forcing users to add a comment of at least ten characters.
为了满足小柠檬的要求，如果分数低于5，提交按钮将被禁用，迫使用户添加至少10个字符的评论。

Now let's examine the code.

The entry point is the app.JS component where I'm rendering a feedback form component.

This component receives a prop on submit which is a function that contains the values of the form as parameters so that the parent app component can perform the submission.

The feedback form represents an HTML form and includes two controlled components via local state, arranged input, and the text area.

There are two pieces to highlight in this component.

The first is the button disabled logic is disabled is the variable that controls that state and is set to true if the score is lower than five and the comment has less than ten characters.

The other important piece is the handle submit function which is hooked into the form on submit attribute.

When the submit button is clicked, the handle submit function will be called.

This function itself calls the prop function provided by the parent with the corresponding form values.

Well, it's clear that the feedback form component contains all the business logic of interest.

So let's go ahead and write a test for the `submission` logic.

The convention for test is to create them inside a file that has the dot test extension.
测试的约定是在具有点 test 扩展名的文件中创建它们。
That way, jest the test runner is able to pick them up automatically when you run the test command in your terminal.
这样，当您在终端中运行测试命令时，测试运行器就可以自动选择它们。

As I have already written a `test scenario`, I will now walk you through each line of code so that you understand how the test is structured step by step.

The test scenario is checking that users are prevented from submitting the form right away if the score is lower than five and there is either no additional feedback or it's too short.

First, I create a new mock function with jest, recall that a mock function is a special function that allows you to track how a particular function is called by external code.
首先，我用 jest 创建一个新的模拟函数，回想一下模拟函数是一个特殊的函数，它允许您跟踪外部代码如何调用特定函数。

When the feedback form calls the function you provide as the on-submit prop, you will be able to explore the argument passed in the call.
当反馈表单调用您作为 on-submit 属性提供的函数时，您将能够探索调用中传递的参数。

Then, I render the feedback form and pass the mock function as the on-submit prop.
然后，我呈现反馈表单并将模拟函数作为 on-submit 属性传递。

The following steps are needed to locate the range input and fill it with a value, notice that to find the input I'm using the screen.get by label text and passing a regular expression to match against.

Screen is a utility object from react testing library that represents the whole page which basically translates to asking the root document to find a label tag whose text contains the word score and then return the input element associated with that label.

To fill the input with the value you have to use the fire event utility from React testing library and call the change function.

While React-controlled components update their state via the unchanged prop, React testing library follows a slightly different convention, removing the on part and having the update method as lower case.

To simulate the form, submission I have to locate the button element, observe how I'm using a different query method.

Get by roll which looks at elements with a specific role attribute.

This will work well since the HTML button already has the button role internally set, to simulate the event I need to provide two arguments.

First, the input element in question and second the browser event object which holds the new value as target.value.

To perform a button click I have to use fireevent.click.

It follows the same convention as before removing the on-site of the prop and having everything in lower case.


需要执行以下步骤来定位范围输入并用值填充它，请注意，为了查找输入，我正在使用 screen.get 按标签文本并传递要匹配的正则表达式。

Screen 是来自 React 测试库的一个实用程序对象，它代表整个页面，基本上转换为要求根文档查找文本包含单词分数的标签标签，然后返回与该标签关联的输入元素。

要使用值填充输入，您必须使用 React 测试库中的火灾事件实用程序并调用更改函数。

虽然 React 控制的组件通过未更改的 prop 更新其状态，但 React 测试库遵循略有不同的约定，删除了 on 部分并将更新方法设置为小写。

为了模拟表单提交，我必须找到按钮元素，观察我如何使用不同的查询方法。

按滚动获取，查看具有特定角色属性的元素。

这会很好地工作，因为 HTML 按钮已经在内部设置了按钮角色，为了模拟事件，我需要提供两个参数。

首先是相关的输入元素，其次是浏览器事件对象，该对象将新值保存为 target.value。

要执行按钮单击，我必须使用 fireevent.click。

它遵循与之前相同的约定，删除了道具的现场并将所有内容都改为小写。
Great.

The final two statements are the assertions of the test.

The first one illustrates an example of an expect matter that wants to check the opposite by pre-pending the not before calling the final matter.

What it's asserting is that the function that handles the submission of the form has not been called, which is what I'm expecting when an additional comment has been omitted.

Furthermore, I have added the second assertion to make sure the submit button is indeed disabled by using the to have attributes matter.

And that's it.

Well, done for reaching the end of this demonstration.

In this video, you learned how you can shield your business logic with a few lines of powerful code, thanks to the React testing library.

And what's more important it has enabled the chef at Little Lemon to finally receive the necessary feedback and make sure all the new pizzas have a bit more extra cheese on top.
