you send a request to look for 

something online and how 

that information gets back to you. 

Then you were introduced to 

core Internet technologies and how they interact. 

You explore some web browser tools that you 

can use to help you code more efficiently. 

Finally, you learned what an IDE is 

and how it can help you speed up your work to write code. 

An introduction to HTML and CSS followed Module 2. 

In Module 2, you learned about HTML and CSS. 

In HTML, you discovered how to create an HTML document,

You explored how to select and style

and some alternatives to react. 

Well done on completing this course recap. 

Now it's time to put into practice 

all that you've learned in the graded assessment.

Good luck.
