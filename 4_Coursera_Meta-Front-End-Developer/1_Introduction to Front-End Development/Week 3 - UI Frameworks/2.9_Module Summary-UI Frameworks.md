You've reached the end of this module on UI frameworks, 

is now time to review what 

you've learned during these lessons. 

Over the course of this module, 

you've explored the concepts of 

UI frameworks and libraries, 

and covered an introduction to React. 

Let's recap the key points you 

learned and the skills you gained. 

You began the module with 

an introduction to UI frameworks. 

Following the completion of this first lesson, 

you should now be able to 

utilize CSS and JavaScript libraries, 

demonstrate a high level understanding of dependencies, 

package managers, and JavaScript bundlers, 

and explain the key techniques and 

concepts of responsive web design, 

such as screen resolutions and fixed and fluid grids. 

You should also be able to develop 

a simple Bootstrap website with the use of HTML and CSS. 

Utilize Bootstrap CSS library, 

including deploying class in fixes for 

responsive breakpoints and class modifiers to change 

your CSS code and demonstrate an understanding of 

Bootstrap's grid system by building 

a web page using the Bootstrap grid. 

Following your exploration of 

UI frameworks and libraries, 

you then covered an introduction to React and 

the JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

Now that you've completed an introduction to react, 

you should be able to differentiate 

between static and dynamic web page content. 

List examples of how each type 

works in the context of web servers. 

Explain what a single-page application is, 

how it works, and how it 

differs from traditional web applications. 

You should also be able to 

outline the purpose of React as a JavaScript library, 

explain the concept of the React component model, 

and identify examples of common components. 

Demonstrate a high level understanding 

of React components, 

explain how React components operate as 

a hierarchy in order to 

generate a web page through the virtual DOM. 

You're now familiar with the basics 

of UI frameworks and libraries, 

and the basics of React and React Native. 

Excellent. You've made great progress.
