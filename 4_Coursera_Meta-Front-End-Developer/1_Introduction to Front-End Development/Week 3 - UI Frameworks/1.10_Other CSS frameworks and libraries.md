### Pure.css

Pure.css is another library for building user interfaces. While it doesn't have as many features as Bootstrap, it is designed to be minimal in file size. Smaller file sizes improve loading times for web pages as there is less data to transfer from the web server. If your next project is focused on minimal loading time, this library is worth considering.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that uses a utility-based approach for its CSS rules. This means that the framework provides many CSS classes with a single purpose. For example, the CSS class pt-6 sets the padding-top CSS property to 6 pixels. This means that you can be precise in applying styling to your HTML without writing CSS. The advantage to this is that it is more flexible for customizing your webpage's design using the framework. However, the disadvantage is that if multiple developers are working on a project, it could lead to inconsistent design if the team is not strict on its design rules.

MVP.css is a small CSS library that automatically styles HTML elements without needing to apply CSS classes to them.
