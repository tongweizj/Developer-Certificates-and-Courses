# Setting up your local development environment

This reading walks you through the steps to set up an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, on a Windows and on a Mac (further down below).

The IDE you'll be using in the course is Visual Studio Code, which Microsoft provides for free and comes with a wealth of plugins and extensions to make your life as a developer easier.

You have two options for using Visual Studio Code to complete your course activities:

**Option 1: Use Visual Studio Code in-browser with Coursera Labs**

Coursera’s platform offers an in-browser version of Visual Studio Code which is preconfigured and requires no local setup. You can access the Visual Studio Code environment through the “Lab” items included in this course. Your work and files will be saved and available within this in-browser lab while you have course access.

**Option 2: Work on your local device**

You can also choose to complete your work on your local machine if you prefer. This will require a few steps of set up in advance. 

First, you need to download the IDE from Microsoft's website - [https://code.visualstudio.com/downloadOpens in a new tab](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "https://code.visualstudio.com/download").

Select the download based on your operating system.
