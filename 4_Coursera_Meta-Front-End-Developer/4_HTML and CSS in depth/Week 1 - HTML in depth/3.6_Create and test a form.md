In this exercise, you’ll create a basic login form for the Little Lemon website. The form will contain two fields: one for the username and another for the password. Both fields are required fields and must have a minimum text length of 2. The form will also contain a button to submit the form.

**Instructions**

**Step 1:** First add a form element to the body of the HTML document.

**Step 2:** Next, add two div elements; one for the username field and one for the password.

**Step 3:** In the first div element, add a label element for the username.

**Step 4:** After the label, add an input element for the username.

**Step 5:** Add the required and minlength attributes. Set the minlength attribute value to 2 so that the field requires a minimum text length of 2.

**Step 6:** Add an id attribute to the input element. Ensure that the for attribute of the label is set to match the id.

**Step 7:** In the second div element, add a label element for the password.

**Step 8:** After the label, add an input element for the password. Ensure the correct input type is used so that the inputted data is not visible on screen.

**Step 9:** Add an id attribute to the input element. Ensure that the for attribute of the label is set to match the id.

**Step 10:** Add the required and minlength attributes to the input element. Set the minlength attribute value to 2 so that the field requires a minimum text length of 2.

**Step 11:** Add a name attribute to all input elements.

**Step 12:** After the second div element, add a button element containing the text "Log In".

**Step 13:** Set the type attribute of the button element to submit.

**Step 14:** Save the HTML document and open it in Live Preview.

**Step 15:** Click the Log In button and note if the form submits successfully. The form submits successfully when no errors are displayed and the content of the form resets.

**Step 16:** Add one character of text to both input fields. Again, click the Log In button and note if the form submits successfully.

**Step 17:** Type the text "admin" in the username field. Then type the text "password" in the password field. Click the Log In button and note if the form submits successfully.

When you complete the exercise, the web page should be similar to the following image.
