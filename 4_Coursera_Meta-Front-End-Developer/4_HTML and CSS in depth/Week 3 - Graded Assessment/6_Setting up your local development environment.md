You have to use Visual Studio Code to complete your graded assessment. You have two options to do this.

## **Option 1: Use Visual Studio Code in-browser with Coursera Labs**

You can access the Visual Studio Code environment through the “ Ungraded Lab Project sandbox” included in this lesson. Take note that the Project Sandbox only allows you to work for one hour at a time. Make sure you download your files before exiting the UGL. To work on your project again later, you can simply open the HTML and CSS files on your local machine and copy and paste the code again into the template files in the Project Sandbox. Remember to download the edited versions again at the end of the session.

To submit your project, you need to download the HTML and CSS files to your local machine and save them inside a project folder. Zip the project folder and upload it in the "My submission" area in the Peer review assessment later in this lesson.

## **Option 2: Work on your local device**

You can also choose to complete your graded assessment on your local machine if you prefer. This will require a few steps of set up in advance. 

First, you need to download the free IDE from Microsoft's website - [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "https://code.visualstudio.com/download").

### Selecting a working directory

Now that you have Visual Studio Code set up create a folder on your device that you'll use to do course exercises.

Open Visual Studio Code, go to File and select Open Folder. Using the file browser, select the folder you just created.

Congratulations, you're set up now to begin writing some code.
