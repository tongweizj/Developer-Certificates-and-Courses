# Assessment and evaluation
评估与评价


There are three types of assessments that will support your learning throughout this course.


## Self-check quizzes

At the end of each learning activity, you will be given the opportunity to compete a self-check quiz. Complete the questions in the quiz to review the concepts covered in the learning activity and check your own understanding.

Once you submit the quiz, you will be able to access feedback for each question. Read the feedback provided and compare it to your submitted answer. For any incorrect answers, it would help to review the concept again by revisiting the learning activity.

Self-check quizzes will not be marked. You have the opportunity to try the quizzes as many times as you would like.

在每次学习活动结束时，您将有机会参加自测测验。 完成测验中的问题以回顾学习活动中涵盖的概念并检查您自己的理解。
提交测验后，您将能够访问每个问题的反馈。 阅读提供的反馈并将其与您提交的答案进行比较。 
对于任何不正确的答案，通过重新审视学习活动来再次回顾概念将有所帮助。
**自检测验不会被评分。 您有机会尝试多次测验。**

## Assignments
作业
Assignments are included throughout the course. Be sure to read the provided instructions carefully before submitting your assignment. You will receive a grade and descriptive feedback from your teacher marker about your strengths, areas for improvement, and next steps.

Note: Assignments must be completed in the order that they appear in the course.

作业包含在整个课程中。 
在提交作业之前，请务必仔细阅读所提供的说明。 
您将收到老师评分者的评分和描述性反馈，内容涉及您的优势、需要改进的领域以及后续步骤。

注意：作业必须按照它们在课程中出现的顺序完成。

## Submitting assignments

All written work submitted to TVO ILC should be typed. Scanned copies of handwritten work will not be accepted with some exceptions in the math and sciences (Refer to Math and Science Communication Requirements located in the “My Home” section of your course).

ILC courses are designed so that you can only submit assignments in the order that they appear in the course. You can view the order in the "Grades" tab. You will not be able to access all the submission spaces for the assignments that are for grading all at once. Drop boxes for assignments that are for grading appear to students sequentially. Once your previous assignment that is for grading is marked and returned, the next submission space in the assignments page will become available to you.

When you submit an assignment, make sure to submit the fewest possible number of files. You may need to combine files or template files from the course to create a file for submission. On average, you should not exceed 1-2 files in a single submission. Submitting too many files may result in delays in marking your submission. Similarly, submitting the wrong type of file can result in an assignment being returned as incomplete. TVO ILC only accepts Word (.docx) and PDF files for submission unless otherwise stated within the assignment. For video or audio files, please upload your files to public sharing services and include a link within your submitted document.

所有提交给 TVO ILC 的书面作品均应打印。 
除数学和科学方面的一些例外情况外，不接受手写作业的扫描副本（请参阅课程“我的家”部分中的数学和科学交流要求）。

ILC 课程的设计使您只能按照作业在课程中出现的顺序提交作业。 
您可以在“成绩”选项卡中查看顺序。 
您将无法同时访问用于评分的作业的所有提交空间。 
用于评分的作业的投递箱会按顺序向学生显示。 
一旦您之前的评分作业被标记并返回，作业页面中的下一个提交空间将可供您使用。

当您提交作业时，请确保提交尽可能少的文件数量。 
您可能需要合并课程中的文件或模板文件来创建要提交的文件。 
平均而言，一次提交的文件不应超过 1-2 个。 
提交太多文件可能会导致标记提交的时间延迟。 
同样，提交错误类型的文件可能会导致作业因不完整而被返回。 
TVO ILC 仅接受 Word (.docx) 和 PDF 文件提交，除非作业中另有说明。 
对于视频或音频文件，请将文件上传到公共共享服务，并在提交的文档中包含链接。
