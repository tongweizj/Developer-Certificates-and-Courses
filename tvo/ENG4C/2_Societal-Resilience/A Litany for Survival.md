For those of us who live at the shoreline  

standing upon the constant edges of decision  

crucial and alone  

for those of us who cannot indulge  

the passing dreams of choice  

who love in doorways coming and going  

in the hours between dawns  

looking inward and outward  

at once before and after  

seeking a now that can breed  

futures  

like bread in our children’s mouths  

so their dreams will not reflect  

the death of ours;  

   

For those of us  

who were imprinted with fear  

like a faint line in the center of our foreheads  

learning to be afraid with our mother’s milk  

for by this weapon  

this illusion of some safety to be found  

the heavy-footed hoped to silence us  

For all of us  

this instant and this triumph  

We were never meant to survive.  

   

And when the sun rises we are afraid  

it might not remain  

when the sun sets we are afraid  

it might not rise in the morning  

when our stomachs are full we are afraid  

of indigestion  

when our stomachs are empty we are afraid  

we may never eat again  

when we are loved we are afraid  

love will vanish  

when we are alone we are afraid  

love will never return  

and when we speak we are afraid  

our words will not be heard  

nor welcomed  

but when we are silent  

we are still afraid  

   

So it is better to speak  

remembering  

we were never meant to survive.
