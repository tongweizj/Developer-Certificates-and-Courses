In the last learning activity, you learned about the reader response lens and the historical/biographical lens. In this learning activity, you will be exploring the psychological lens and the gender lens, and how to apply them when analyzing texts.

Select the following tabs to explore some sample questions about the apple for each of the lenses.


#### Reader Response Lens

- What does the apple taste like?
- What does the apple remind me of?

####  Historical/Biographical Lens

- What were the weather patterns and harvesting methods used when this apple was picked?
- What was the grower’s favourite variety of apple?
#### Psychological Lens
- Does the apple consider itself an orange on a subconscious level?
- Is the apple denying its true self?
####  Gender Lens
- Is the apple equally available to all gender identities? How does the taste change depending on who you are?



### Think
To review the two literary lenses you explored in the last learning activity and to introduce yourself to the two lenses you will be exploring in this learning activity, consider the example of the apple and think about the following questions. Using the reader response lens and the historical/biographical lens, what questions might you ask about an apple? Going by just the name of the lenses, what questions do you think someone with the psychological lens and gender lens might ask?



### Review

Before you learn more about the psychological lens and gender lens, review the suggested guidelines for using literary lenses by selecting the following **Bold text startSuggested GuidelinesBold text End** tab.

- Each lens requires background knowledge to apply it.

It's now time for you to learn more about the psychological lens and the gender lens. Select the following tabs to read a description of each lens.

#### Psychological lens

- Views the text through the lens of psychology and psychoanalytic theory, focusing on the motivations, personalities, feelings, desires, impulses, and behaviour of characters. The work of Sigmund Freud is often referenced.

#### Gender lens
- Views text as a commentary on how people from across the gender spectrum are portrayed in society. Gender representations, gender roles, and power dynamics are explored.

You will now have the opportunity to take a deeper dive into the psychological lens and the gender lens. First, select the psychological lens to learn more about the lens. When you're done, return to this main page and select the gender lens to learn more about that lens.

### Notebook

In your notebook, reflect on your learning. You explored the psychological lens and the gender lens by researching and applying what you learned. Answer the following questions:

- What do you think your strengths and weaknesses are as a reader? Which part of this learning activity was the most challenging? How did you overcome the challenges?
- Of the seven transferable skills (critical thinking, creativity and innovation, communication, collaboration, global citizenship and sustainability, self-directed learning, and digital fluency), which ones have you practised and improved on in this learning activity? Explain with examples.
- How comfortable are you with applying the psychological lens and gender lens as a reader? Can you identify some strategies and skills that will help increase your confidence in this area?


## Unit reflection


You have now completed Unit 3. Congratulations on your effort and engagement!

You have learned to use literary lenses to develop a deeper, more global understanding of a text, and to challenge and to broaden your perspective. By applying different literary lenses to analyze short stories in this unit, you were able to explore the concept of resilience through a more global lens.

Revisit your motivation sheet from the beginning of this course (back in Learning Activity 1.1). Make any changes to it based on how you felt working through Unit 3. What is your goal for Unit 4?

## Culminating project

As previously stated at the start of the course, you will select a novel to read independently in Unit 4 and use what you have learned in this course to create a reading journal for the [culminating project(Opens in new window)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assignments/eng4c_u4la2_assign1.html?ou=22862564). If you would like to get a head start on choosing and reading your novel, feel free to go ahead and explore Learning Activity 4.1 to learn about the novel options you can choose from and the novel selection process you should follow to make an informed choice. If you would like to get a head start by starting to work on your reading journal for the culminating project, explore Learning Activity 4.2 for specific instructions and guidelines on developing a reading journal.
