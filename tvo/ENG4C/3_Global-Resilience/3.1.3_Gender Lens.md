You've put on the gender lens. This means that you will interpret what you are reading through this perspective.

## Definition

Gender lens

- Views text as a commentary on how people from across the gender spectrum are portrayed in society.
- Gender representations, gender roles, and power dynamics are explored.

> What used to be called feminist theory, the critical lens of gender examines the social construction of gender roles and the limits they impose upon people in society and in relationships ... The gender lens enables readers to expose and consider societal constraints that are the result of one’s gender, and work through how texts and authors help explain, challenge, and exploit traditional gender roles.

Gender analysis is based on questions such as the following:

- What are the attitudes towards gender roles and gender identities? Are the attitudes explicit or implicit?
- How do literary conventions (for example, the happy ending) reinforce or challenge gender stereotypes?
- What gender stereotypes are reinforced or questioned?
- What assumptions are being made about gender?
- How does gender affect power dynamics?

In order to use the gender lens effectively to analyze literature, you will need a more detailed understanding of this lens.

## Your turn!

### Step 1 - Research

Use a search engine you are familiar with to research and find resources about the gender lens. Use the following documents as a starting point for your research.

Read the following [Feminist Criticism (1960s-present)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_03.01.47.html?ou=22862564) to learn more about the gender lens.

Read the following [Gender Studies and Queer Theory (1970s-present)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_03.01.48.html?ou=22862564) to learn more about the gender lens.

Find out all you can about the gender lens before moving on.

#### Sample gender lens analysis

**Cinderella: A feminist analysisBold text End**

By David Lomax

Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.

Cinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.

Getting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.

At the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.

The prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation could they have had?

The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be a great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?

The mother is willing to mutilate her daughters in order to get them social advancement – again, that is no solidarity among women. She is willing to be abusive to her step-daughter in order to deny her social advancement. The sisters are presented as having no personality other than being greedy and cruel. Thus, women are shown as either powerless innocents or cruel schemers. The loss of their eyes is presented as a just punishment, but all they were trying to do was get the same social advancement that Cinderella was after.

### Think

Now that you've had a chance to explore and apply the gender lens, think about the following questions:

- How would you define the gender lens in one or two sentences?
- How did the research you did about the gender lens help you apply the gender lens?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of this lens?
- How might bias come into play when applying the gender lens to a text?

### “Chicken Hips”

#### by Catherine Pigott

The women of the household clucked disapprovingly when they saw me. It was the first time I had worn African clothes since my arrival in tiny, dusty Gambia, and evidently they were not impressed. They adjusted my head-tie and pulled my lappa, the ankle-length fabric I had wrapped around myself, even tighter, "You’re too thin," one of them pronounced. "It’s no good." They nicknamed me "Chicken-Hips."

Even when you are using a literary lens to analyze a story, you should still be ready to deconstruct the story using what you know about plot, character and theme. 

In your notebook, make a list of new or unfamiliar words, and take notes on the following questions related to plot, character, and theme. If you are applying the gender lens to the same short story you applied the historical/biographical lens to or the psychological lens to, this step should have already been completed.
