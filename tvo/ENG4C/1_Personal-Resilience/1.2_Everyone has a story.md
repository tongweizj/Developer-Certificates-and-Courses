## 1. MINDS ON 专心致志

### 1.1 Resilient storytelling

In the previous learning activity, you explored the idea that being a life-long learner requires both motivation and resilience. In this learning activity, you will consider resilience from a different perspective. You will focus on how telling and sharing stories relate to resilience.
在本次学习活动中，您将从不同的角度考虑韧性。
您将重点关注讲述和分享故事与韧性的关系。

Get started by exploring the following 60-second life stories.


### 1.2 Think

These video clips are just two of the many stories available online. Research additional stories, or think about recent stories you may have encountered. Consider the following questions.

- Are there stories that affect you more than others? Consider why this may be.
- How might storytelling help build resilience? Think back to the synonyms for resilience and adversity at the beginning of the course.

- 讲故事怎么样帮助建立毅力？ 回想一下课程开始时韧性和逆境的同义词。
### 1.3 The personal essay

Storytelling is an important tradition for many cultures and people around the world. 
Some believe that it is ingrained into our DNA as human beings. 
Next, you will be exploring a ==specific== type of storytelling form: ==the personal essay==. 
You are probably most familiar with formal essays. Personal essays are similar, but not the same. Select the following tabs to learn more.

ingrained 根深蒂固

#### personal essay

A personal essay is told with ==descriptive== details and is similar to a personal story or memoir.

descriptive 描述性的

> The core of a personal essay is inward reflection about yourself. This includes insights you have gleaned about your abilities and strengths, significant personal growth you made and what you still need to work on.

个人论文的核心是==对自己的内心反思==。
这包括您收集到的
- 关于您的能力和优势的见解
- 您取得的重大个人成长
- 以及您仍需要努力的方面。

三步骤，非常清楚，
#### formal essay

Like a formal essay, a personal essay conveys a specific point of view or thesis. The thesis can be explicit, but more often it has to be inferred by the reader.
与正式论文一样，个人论文传达了特定的观点或论述。 论述可以是明确的，但更多时候必须由读者推断。

> In a formal essay, a reader is presented with evidence and a conclusion; 
> 
> in a personal essay, a reader is treated to the author wrestling with a problem…. 
> Personal essays work best when they are interesting and entertaining but more so when they provoke a response, whether sympathy or outrage or laughter or head-shaking astonishment.
> 
> Source: Best Canadian Essays 2017

在正式的论文中，向读者提供证据和结论；
在一篇个人论文中，读者会看到作者正在努力解决一个问题…… 
当个人文章吸引人且有趣时，效果最好，但当它们引起反应时，效果更佳，无论是同情、愤怒、笑声还是令人摇头的惊讶。


## 2. Action

### 2.1 Storytelling through personal essays

Storytelling is a way to persevere and ensure that a part of us survives and thrives.
讲故事是一种坚持并确保我们的一部分生存和发展的方式。

Author Ursula K. Le Guin says, "there have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories."
作家乌苏拉·K·勒古恩 (Ursula K. Le Guin) 说：“曾经有过不使用轮子的伟大社会，但没有不讲故事的社会。”

Reading stories in the form of personal essays that describe what it’s like to face challenges can broaden our understanding of what it means to be resilient and human.
阅读以个人文章形式描述面对挑战的故事，可以拓宽我们对坚韧和人性意味着什么的理解。

Consider the following tree diagram to explore how personal essays fit with other forms of descriptive and narrative writing. 
This is not an exact science. In most writing, you’ll often find the branches overlapping. As such, the personal essay borrows from written forms like short stories, memoirs, and other essay structures.
考虑下面的树形图，探索个人论文如何与其他形式的描述性和叙述性写作相结合。 这不是一门精确的科学。 在大多数写作中，您经常会发现分支重叠。 因此，个人论文借鉴了短篇小说、回忆录和其他论文结构等书面形式。

The image shows a labelled diagram of a tree. The head of the tree is divided into three sections. The section on the left is labeled: personal essay. The section in the middle is labeled: descriptive essay. The section on the right is labeled: short story. The "personal essay" section has branches labeled: emotions, anecdotes, thoughts and opinions, diary entries, and memoir. The "Descriptive Essay" section has branches labeled: imagery, five senses, and moment by moment. The "Short Story" section has branches labeled: plot, setting, characters, and genres. The branches from all three sections of the head of the tree lead to the trunk of the tree, which is labeled: description. The truck splits into three main roots. The root on the left is labeled: confessional writing. The root in the middle is labeled: observational writing. The root on the right is labeled: imaginative fiction.

### 2.2 Review 复习

Before you start reading D’Angelo’s essay (and essays in general), you may find it helpful to review a variety of reading strategies.
您可能会发现回顾各种阅读策略很有帮助。

Using reading strategies intentionally will help you develop and improve your reading skills. Review each of the reading strategies by selecting the following tabs.

#### A. Ask yourself questions

For example, ask yourself, “what does the writer mean by …?” or “what do I need to know more about to understand …?”

有意识的增加和文本的互动

#### B. Adjust your pace
调整你的步伐

If you find the text challenging, take more think time to process meaning. 
You may need to reread or pause to think and review.

#### C. Read between the lines
字里行间

Link ideas and draw conclusions. Consider what is implied, or suggested, as well as what is clearly written on the page.
链接想法并得出结论。 
考虑文本中，哪些是暗示或建议的内容，哪些是纸面上明确写的内容。

#### D. Visualize
可视化

Develop a mental image as you read. Some people describe reading a novel as “a movie running through their minds.
阅读时在心里形成一个形象。 
有些人将阅读小说描述为“一部在他们脑海中闪现的电影”。
#### E. Make predictions
做出预测

As you read, think about what might happen next.

#### F. Take notes

Jotting down main ideas and questions can help you remember key information and track your own thinking as you read. In addition, consider looking up the meaning of difficult words and creating a vocabulary list. You can also add notes to the margins of what you are reading (called annotating) to help you guide your reading and deepen your understanding.

记下主要想法和问题可以帮助您记住关键信息并在阅读时跟踪自己的想法。 
此外，考虑查找困难单词的含义并创建词汇表。 
您还可以在正在阅读的内容的页边添加注释（称为注释），以帮助您指导阅读并加深理解。

Consider consulting this annotation guide and using digital annotation tools such the comment feature in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
考虑查阅本注释指南（在新窗口中打开）并使用数字注释工具，例如 Google Docs 或 Microsoft Word 中的注释功能。
#### G. Make connections

Make connections between what you are reading and your own knowledge and experiences. What does the text remind you of? How does the text relate to other things you have learned, seen, heard about, or done? This is sometimes called “mental Velcro,” because you are attaching new information to ideas you already have.

将您正在阅读的内容与您自己的知识和经验联系起来。 
- 文字让你想起什么？ 
- 文本与你所学、所见、所听或所做的其他事情有何联系？ 

这有时被称为“心理魔术贴”，因为你将新信息附加到已有的想法上。
