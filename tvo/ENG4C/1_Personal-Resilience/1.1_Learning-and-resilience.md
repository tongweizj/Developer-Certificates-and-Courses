Angela Lee Duckworth has studied and reported on what motivates people who experience success. In her book, <Grit, Passion, Perseverance, and the Science of Success>, she states:
安吉拉·李·达克沃斯（Angela Lee Duckworth）研究并报告了成功人士的激励因素。 在她的书《勇气、激情、毅力和成功的科学》中，她指出：
> ...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time -- longer than most people imagine...you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people...Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love -- staying in love.
>...追求卓越没有捷径。 
>培养真正的专业知识，解决真正困难的问题，这一切都需要时间——比大多数人想象的要长……
>你必须运用这些技能，生产对人们有价值的商品或服务……
>毅力就是努力工作 你非常关心某件事，以至于你愿意忠于它……
>这是**做你喜欢的事情，但不仅仅是坠入爱河——而是保持热爱**。
> -- Angela Lee Duckworth, Grit, Passion, Perseverance, and the Science of Success

## Action
**Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation**
**内在动机和外在动机**

Learning is driven by motivation. You will now be exploring two kinds of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic. Select each of the following terms to learn more.
**学习是由动机驱动的**。
现在你将探讨两种动机：
- 外在动机
- 和内在动机。

选择以下每个术语以了解更多信息。
### Extrinsic motivation
外在动机
Extrinsic motivation is the pursuit of a goal for the **purpose of an external reward**. The most obvious example is a financial gain, but it can be anything from good grades, or a good work evaluation, to external praise for an accomplishment. When we are extrinsically motivated to pursue a task, we are looking for something outside of ourselves as a reward.
**外在动机是为了获得外部奖励而追求目标**。最明显的例子是经济收益，但它可以是任何事情，从好成绩，良好的工作评估，到对成就的外部赞扬。当我们在外部动机驱使下追求一个任务时，我们寻求的是作为奖励的自身之外的东西。

**Example:** You may be completing this course in order to earn a credit toward your high school diploma.


### Intrinsic motivation

Intrinsic motivation involves the pursuit of goals that have **personal significance**, such as volunteer work. In other words, these pursuits are motivated by the desire to fulfill something personal, without an external reward.”
内在动机涉及追求具有个人意义的目标，比如志愿工作。换句话说，这些追求是**出于实现个人愿望的动机**，而没有外部奖励。

**Example:** You may be completing this course because you are curious and you want to challenge yourself to become a better reader, writer, speaker, and media creator.

Next, you will explore intrinsic motivation in more detail.

### Elements of intrinsic motivation

#### Challenge

People are more motivated when they pursue goals with personal meaning, and when attaining the goal is possible but not necessarily certain. These goals may also relate to their self-esteem when performance feedback is available.
**当人们追求具有个人意义的目标，并且实现目标是可能的但不一定确定时，他们更有动力**。当有绩效反馈时，这些目标也可能与他们的自尊有关。

#### Curiosity

Internal motivation is increased when something in the physical environment grabs the individual's attention (sensory curiosity). It also occurs when something about the activity stimulates the person to want to learn more (cognitive curiosity).
内在动机在以下情况下增加：
- 当物理环境中的某物引起个体的注意力（感觉好奇）时，
- 以及当活动中的某些因素刺激个人想要学到更多的时候（认知好奇）。

#### Control

People want control over themselves and their environments, and want to determine what they pursue.
人们希望对自己和周围的环境有所掌控，并希望决定他们追求什么

#### Cooperation and Competition

合作与竞争

Intrinsic motivation can be increased in situations where people gain satisfaction from helping others. It also applies to cases where they are able to compare their own performance favorably to that of others.
在人们通过帮助他人获得满足感的情境中，内在动机可以增强。
这也适用于那些能够将自己的表现与他人比较得利的情况。

#### Recognition
认可

People enjoy having their accomplishments recognized by others, which can increase internal motivation. This is a tricky one. If the only goal is the external recognition by others, then it's not really intrinsic motivation.
人们喜欢他人认可他们的成就，这可以增强内在动机。这是一个棘手的问题。如果唯一的目标是为了得到他人的外在认可，那么它实际上并不是内在动机。

### Think

Think about your personal experiences with learning both inside and outside of formal school.
想想你在正规学校以及在校外学习的个人经历。

- Has your motivation been mostly extrinsic or intrinsic?
    - Why do you think that is?
- When were you intrinsically motivated to learn?
    - How did your motivation affect the outcome? Explain.

You may find it helpful to write down your thoughts in your notebook or discuss your thinking with a trusted friend or family member.

- 你的动机主要是外在的还是内在的？
    - 你认为这是为什么？
- 什么时候你是内在地被激发去学习的？
    - 你的动机是如何影响结果的？请解释一下。

在你的笔记本上记录下你的想法，或者与信任的朋友或家人讨论你的思考可能会很有帮助。

### Setting goals

Learning often involves setting goals. 
Consider what you know about specific elements of intrinsic motivation like challenge, curiosity, control, cooperation, competition, and recognition. 
Choose one or more of these elements and develop some goals for this course that will help you be successful. 
Setting an intentional goal allows you to better recognize your progress. 
Review the sample goals to get a better idea of what is required.

#### Sample goals

If you choose “curiosity” as the element of intrinsic motivation that you are going to focus on, your goals might be to:

- explore more than one option when given a choice of learning materials to look at
- explore topics that are unfamiliar and present the possibility of learning something new
- select readings based on interest instead of length
- dig in to “discover more” links to explore topics in more depth

- 在有多个学习材料选择时，探索不止一个选项
- 探索那些陌生并可能学到新知识的主题
- 根据兴趣选择阅读材料，而不是长度
- 深入“发现更多”链接，深入探讨主题
## Notebook

Write down your goal(s) for the course in your notebook. You may build on the goals you came up with in the Minds On section of this learning activity.

## Consolidation

So far in this course, you are developing the skills and strategies needed to stay motivated and be successful as a self-directed learner.

**Self-directed learners** are aware of how they learn best. They are confident and know when to ask for support. Self-directed learners set goals and make realistic plans to meet those goals. In other words, they make a commitment to their own learning and take responsibility for it.

Reflective thinking and writing are important strategies that self-directed learners use. Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to use reflective writing to think more deeply about your learning and make your learning visible. You may find it helpful to consult the following [introduction to reflective writing(Opens in new window)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_01.01.100.html?ou=22862564).

Next, you will do some reflective thinking about what motivates you. You will create a motivation sheet to guide your learning throughout the course.


### Try it!

Throughout this course, you will encounter Try It! opportunities where you will complete activities and tasks that will help you apply your learning and make learning engaging. These opportunities can serve as ways for you to self-assess your understanding of concepts learned in learning activities and can thus, help prepare you for graded assessments in the course.

#### Motivation sheet

Create a motivation sheet of five or more tips that can help you achieve your goals in this course. Consider what you know about intrinsic motivation, and reflect on what keeps you going. Revisiting the goals you wrote down in your notebook is a great place to start.

You may wish to use the following sample resources as inspiration. There are many more resources available online.
