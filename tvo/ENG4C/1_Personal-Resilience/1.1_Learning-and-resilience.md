Angela Lee Duckworth has studied and reported on what motivates people who experience success. In her book, <Grit, Passion, Perseverance, and the Science of Success>, she states:
安吉拉·李·达克沃斯（Angela Lee Duckworth）研究并报告了成功人士的激励因素。 在她的书《勇气、激情、毅力和成功的科学》中，她指出：
> ...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time -- longer than most people imagine...you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people...Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love -- staying in love.
>...追求卓越没有捷径。 培养真正的专业知识，解决真正困难的问题，这一切都需要时间——比大多数人想象的要长……你必须运用这些技能，生产对人们有价值的商品或服务……毅力就是努力工作 你非常关心某件事，以至于你愿意忠于它……它是做你喜欢的事，但不仅仅是坠入爱河——保持爱。
