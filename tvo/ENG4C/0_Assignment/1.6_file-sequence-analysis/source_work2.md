场景以一个长镜头（LS）开始，三个靠近镜头的男人，8号，4号和12号之间的对话，而陪审员们正在精确地观看这场对话。 他们关于被告无罪的论点激怒了第二陪审团，他问了电影的关键问题：“他被杀时你在房间里吗？” 在0:15:33的时间段，摄像机开始向前跟踪陪审团N0.8，因此观看者似乎走在他的后面。 在整个片段中只能听到叙事声音。

场景2

场景3
Around segment 01:16:15, The camera starts slowly to move (pans) to the left while jury No.10 is walking simultaneously. The camera shows a close up of his face, providing an eye-level point-of-view shot of the jury No.7. At the last 30 seconds of this segment, we have continues camera cut and close up between two faces conveying sense of regret. At the same time, only diegetic sound is present and the drops of sweat on the jury No 7’s forehead attracts lots of attention.  
01:16:15左右，摄像机开始缓慢向左移动（平移），同时10号陪审团也在行走。 镜头显示了他脸部的特写镜头，提供了七号陪审团的平眼视角镜头。 在这个片段的最后30秒，我们不断地切镜头并在两张脸之间进行特写，传达出遗憾的感觉。 与此同时，只有叙事声音出现，七号评委额头上的汗珠吸引了很多人的注意。

场景4
The camera transaction to the close up of jury No.12 shows eye-level of his face for around 5 second, and this gives the viewer a sense of accomplishment when eventually he was convinced about young boy not being guilty. The camera shot turns into a long shot of the jury deliberation room as all jurors could be seen clearly. Diegetic sound of rain is still heard during vote. The camera transits to medium shot of jury No.10, and after pausing around 5 second to show his angry emotion in a very obvious way, the camera slowly dolly out of him and zoom out to a high-angle. Then, viewer is provided with a sense of refrain from listening him and leaving table as same as others.
镜头对 12 号陪审团的特写镜头显示了他脸部的视线水平约 5 秒，这让观众在最终确信小男孩无罪时有一种成就感。 镜头变成了陪审团审议室的长镜头，所有陪审员都清晰可见。 投票时仍能听到令人心旷神怡的雨声。 镜头切换到10号陪审团的中景，停顿了大约5秒，以非常明显的方式表现出他的愤怒情绪后，镜头慢慢地从他身上移开，拉远到高角度。 然后，观众就会有一种避免听他说话并像其他人一样离开餐桌的感觉。
