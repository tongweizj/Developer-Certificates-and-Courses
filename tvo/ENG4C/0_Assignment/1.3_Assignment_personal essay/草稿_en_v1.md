In ninth grade, science classes became a big problem for me.

When I first started school, I felt that I was smart enough. Even though I was in high school, I would definitely be able to get good grades using the primary school learning methods. My method is to sit comfortably in the classroom during class and listen to the teacher's lectures in a relaxed manner. I can definitely remember all the concepts and theories without having to waste time and effort taking notes. Do your homework after class. This will definitely give you a good grade in the exam. At the weekend, it’s fun, no need to review, let alone find some other materials to study, these are such a waste of my smart brain!

But obviously I was wrong, the midterm exam completely defeated me! My grades had just passed, and the moment I got the test paper, my mind went blank! After class, when I walked out of the classroom, my feet were so weak that I was almost walking on the wall!

Is this how I studied before? Aren’t the results pretty good? Why did he just pass this time? Have I become stupid? Or was it someone who played a trick on me and secretly changed my answer? As I held onto the wall and thought about the teacher saying the median was 82, I knew I was in big trouble!

In science class the next week, I sat in my seat in a daze. I didn't know how to study. So I wanted to see other students and see how they studied? Maybe you can help me find the answer!

In front of me is my old friend and elementary school classmate Ali. His grades have always been good before, but this time his score in the science test was worse than mine and he failed. I looked at where he was sitting, as if he was listening to the teacher, but why was he always lowering his head? I only looked up at the blackboard once in a while! Finally, I discovered his secret. There seemed to be a comic book on his desk, hidden under the handouts. It turns out that this guy is reading comics while in class! After I entered high school, I had a lot more homework than in elementary school. I barely have time to read comics and play games. But every time we go to the library together, he always borrows a bunch of comic books. It turns out that he was also watching it during class! I think this is the reason why he failed! He didn't study well in class. No matter how smart he is, it's useless!

Not far from Ali is a little girl with some freckles on her nose, Miya. She is a new classmate in high school. She listened to the teacher carefully. There was her folder on the table, and she was taking notes while listening to the lecture. I remember she did well in the exam this time. So how did she learn it?
Last weekend, when Ali and I went to the library, we met her in the study area by the window. She was sitting there with her laptop, handouts and homework on the table. We said hello to her and chatted for a while. I remember there were no games or comics on her desk. She was probably going to study on her own. By the way, what was opened in the browser was the science course at Khan Academy. Is she learning science again on the website? Or should I do the Khan Academy exercises again after reviewing the lecture notes?
Oh, it turns out that she not only did the homework given by the teacher, but also found extracurricular homework by herself, and she also spent extra time reviewing.

I seem to have found an answer that I don't really like! The answer is definitely not smart or not.
The three of us had three grades. Ali failed, I just passed, and Miya almost got perfect marks.
Our study time is different. Ali hardly studies, I almost only study during class, and Miya also spends a lot of time studying after class.
Our learning attitudes are also different. Ali doesn't care about anything. I passively accept and learn whatever the teacher teaches. Miya is an active learner. She can figure it out on her own, find auxiliary learning materials, and do extra exercises.
By the way, I still persist. We definitely saw miya studying in the library more than once. Or she goes every day.

That's the answer I don't like.
Studying in high school is not just a matter of being a little clever and you can get good grades! You need to work harder, be more proactive, and be more persistent. Studying hard for 3 days and playing crazy for 2 days will not get good results. Instead, study in a planned way, invest more time every day, do more exercises, and put all the knowledge into your mind bit by bit. Only in this way can you get good results.

What should I do?
It would be great if there really was memory bread in this world. If you slap it on a book and eat it, you can put all the knowledge into your brain!
