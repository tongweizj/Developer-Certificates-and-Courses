# Sound Of Da Police

by KRS-One

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Stand clear! Don man a-talk

You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk

Watch out! We run New York

Police man come, we bust him out the park

I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act

You claim I'm sellin' crack
表态！ 唐曼谈话

你不能站在我站的地方，你不能走我走的地方

小心！ 我们经营纽约

警察来了，我们把他赶出了公园

我知道这是事实，你不喜欢我的行为

你声称我在卖快克
But you be doin' that

I'd rather say "see ya"

Cause I would never be ya

Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!

Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour

First show a little respect, change your behavior

Change your attitude, change your plan

There could never really be justice on stolen land

Are you really for peace and equality?

Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me

Your laws are minimal

Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal

This has got to cease

Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Now here's a likkle truth

Open up your eye

While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise

Take the word "overseer," like a sample

Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example

Overseer

Overseer

Overseer

Overseer

Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!

Yeah, officer from overseer

You need a little clarity?

Check the similarity!

The overseer rode around the plantation

The officer is off patroling all the nation

The overseer could stop you what you're doing

The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing

The overseer had the right to get ill

And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill

The officer has the right to arrest

And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!

(Woop!) They both ride horses

After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!

The police them have a little gun

So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
是的，监督官

你需要一点澄清吗？

检查相似度！

监工骑着马绕着种植园转了一圈

这名警官正在全国范围内巡逻

监督者可能会阻止你正在做的事情

警察追你的时候就会把你拦下来

监督者有权生病

如果你反抗，监督者有权杀人

该官员有权逮捕

如果你反抗，他们就会在你的胸口打一个洞！

（哇！）他们都骑马

400 年后，我别无选择！

警察他们有一把小枪

所以当我在街上时，我会带着一个更大的人走来走去

(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day

Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop!

That's the sound of the beast!

Check out the message in a rough stylee

The real criminals are the C-O-P

You check for undercover and the one PD

But just a mere Black man, them want check me

Them check out me car for it shine like the sun

But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one

Black people still slaves up til today

But the Black police officer nah see it that way
那是野兽的声音！

以粗略的方式查看消息

真正的罪犯是C-O-P

你检查卧底和一名警察

但只是一个黑人，他们想检查我

他们检查了我的车，因为它像太阳一样闪闪发光

但他们嫉妒或烦恼，因为他们买不起

直到今天黑人仍然是奴隶

但黑人警察不这么认为
Him want a salary

Him want it

So he put on a badge and kill people for it

My grandfather had to deal with the cops

My great-grandfather dealt with the cops

My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops

And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!
所以他戴上徽章并为此杀人

我的祖父不得不与警察打交道

我的曾祖父曾与警察打过交道

我的曾祖父不得不与警察打交道

然后我的伟大，伟大，伟大，伟大......什么时候才能停止？
