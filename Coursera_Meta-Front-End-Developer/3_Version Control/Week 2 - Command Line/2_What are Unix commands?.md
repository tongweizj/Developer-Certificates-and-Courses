I'm pretty sure you use your phone to 

perform a number of activities, 

such as sending messages, 

shopping online and watching videos. 

You simply tap your screen, scroll and swipe. 

But have you ever thought of how your phone 

responds to your tapping, scrolling, and swiping? 

You interact with your phone and computer through 

a graphic user interface or GUI, 

which is just a layer above 

underlying commands that tells the device what to do. 

Developers, however, need to know how to use 

specific commands to perform various types of tasks. 

For example, to create a new folder on the desktop, 

you right-click and choose New Folder. 

In the command line, 

use the specific command mkdir 

to achieve the same result. 

Having a grip on UNIX commands specifically is 

a great skill to have in 

today's software development world. 

In this video, you will get started with 

a few basic Unix commands. 

Did you know that the majority of 

companies run their platforms on the Cloud, 

and 90 percent of these systems 

run on a platform called Linux? 

You might be wondering why I am discussing Linux, 

while the topic of this video is Unix commands. 

To answer this, let's explore some history. 

Unix preceded Linux and was developed by Ken Thompson and 

Dennis Ritchie and team at AT&T Labs in 1969. 

Linux came much later on and was originally 

developed as a hobby by Linus Torvalds, 

hence the name Linux. 

The commands that you will explore in 

this video originated from the Unix platform, 

but you can use them in 

most modern environments that run some flavor of Linux. 

Using the command line could seem 

a little intimidating at first, 

but you will quickly learn that Unix commands are 

simply a layer below the normal actions, 

such as opening file directories or renaming files. 

Windows, for example, 

became the dominant desktop operating system, 

mainly due to it's easier to use GUI. 

Windows allowed non-technical users to perform 

tasks without having to learn a list of commands. 

But you, as an aspiring developer, 

will get to use Unix commands to develop those tasks. 

Before I delve into some of the most common commands, 

it's important to note that 

each command has a set of helper instructions. 

These helpers give detailed information 

about how the commands can 

be run and how something we call flags can be passed. 

One of these helpers is the man command. 

Man is short for manual, 

and when called against a command, 

it will display a detailed manual of 

instructions for that given command. 

You can also use the command man space ls, 

which will show the detailed manual of 

instructions for the list command ls. 

We can also use something called 

flags in conjunction with Unix commands. 

Flags are used to modify the behavior of a command. 

Think of them as options that can either change 

or extend the functionality of the given command. 

Next, you will learn about some of the 

most common to use Unix commands, 

and in the next video, 

you will see some of them in action. 

The cd or change directory command is 

used to move from different directories 

of the file system. 

You can learn more about working with 

relative and absolute paths 

from the additional reading at the end of this lesson. 

Ls is used to show 

the contents of the current working directory. 

The ls command can accept many different types 

of flags that will change 

what is returned in the response. 

For example, ls -l, 

lists the file out, 

in list order, 

and shows the read or write permissions, 

owners and groups it belongs to. 

Ls -a, on the other hand, 

will list all files and 

directories including hidden ones. 

The PWD or print 

working directory command shows 

the full path of the current working directory. 

The copy or cp command copies files 

or folders from one destination to another, 

and the MV, move command, 

moves files from one directory to another. 

In this video, you learned about some of 

the most commonly used Unix commands. 

Next time you use your device, 

think about the commands that run underneath 

the GUI to complete tasks and commands.
