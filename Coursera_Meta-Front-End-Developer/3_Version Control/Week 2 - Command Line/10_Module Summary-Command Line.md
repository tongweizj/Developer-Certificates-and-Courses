Great work. You've reached 

the end of this module on the command line. 

It's now time to review what 

you've learned during these lessons. 

In this module, you've learned how to use 

the command line to execute commands in Linux. 

You were introduced to some of 

the most commonly used commands that traverse, 

create, rename, and delete files on your hard drive. 

You've learned how to use piping and redirection to 

create powerful workflows that automate your work. 

Having completed this module, 

you should be able to describe 

what the command line is and how it is used. 

Explore your hard drive using the command line. 

Create, rename, 

and delete files and folders on your hard drive using 

Unix commands and use pipes and redirection. 

This module began with a video 

exploring the answer to the question, 

what are Unix commands? 

You learned how to determine 

the current working directory using the PWD command. 

You also explored how to create and change 

directories and files using the command line. 

You can now create a working directory, 

create two different directories: dir 1 and dir 2, 

create files and directories inside dir 1 and dir 2. 

You can now also use Grep to search for files, 

folders, and contents of files. 

You're now familiar with the command line. 

Well done. You're making 

good progress on your learning journey.
