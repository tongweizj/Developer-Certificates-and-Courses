Okay. I've opened up my terminal window. 

Let's navigate to my home directory. 

I type the CD command and then a tilde, 

followed by the Enter key. 

Then I use the LS-LA command to 

return all of the files in 

a list including all hidden files. 

Notice two files, a bashRC file and a bash profile file. 

For now, I want you to focus on the bash RC file first. 

I can use the command les.bashRC to check this file. 

The bashRC file is mainly for configurations. 

It is essentially a script file that's 

executed when you first open the terminal window. 

What's in there will be configurations 

for the shell itself, 

for example, the types of colors that I'm using. 

I can also add in things around my shell history, 

like how much history of 

previous commands I want to store and so on. 

Any configuration options that I put in here 

will be executed when the terminal session begins. 

I press the Q key to exit the less environment. 

The other file is the bash profile file. 

I can run the less command again, this time with.profile. 

This tends to be used more for environment variables. 

For example, I can use 

it for setting environment variables for 

my Java home directory or 

my Python home directory 

or whatever is needed during development. 

Again, I press the Q key to exit. 

Now, I will create a simple shell script. 

For this example, I will use Vim, 

which is an editor that I can use which accepts input. 

Type Vim and then I create a new file by 

typing the test shell.sh and press the Enter key. 

Then at the top of the file, 

I put in what type of file I want it to be. 

In this case, it's going to be a bash file. 

If I press the I key on my keyboard, 

it'll set insert mode. 

Then I put in a hash symbol 

followed by an exclamation mark, 

a forward slash, the word bin, 

another forward slash and then the word bash. 

This let's to the operating system 

know that this is a bash script. 

This script is very simple. 

I want to print out some type of text onto the screen. 

I use the echo command 

and type in what I want to print out. 

In this case, HelloWorld, 

press "Escape" to get out of insert mode. 

Then I type:wq! 

to save the file. Press "Enter". 

If I look in the directories now, 

notice there's now a file named testshell.sh. 

The other thing to notice is that 

this file can't be run at the moment. 

In other words, it's not executable. 

It's just a read write file. 

But I want it to be executable, 

which requires that I have an x being set on it. 

In order to do that, 

I have to use another command which is called chmod. 

After using this command, 

I type in the type of permissions that I want. 

I type in 755. 

Then I want to set 

the file that I want to add the permissions 

to, which is testshell.sh. 

If I use the LS-LA command again, 

I notice that the file has now been 

turned into an executable file. 

This means that I can now run 

the file from the command line. 

To run the file, 

I press./testshell.sh followed by the Enter key. 

Now you notice the words hello 

world are printed out on the screen. 

This is how you can create simple scripts 

and make them executable within the bash shell.
