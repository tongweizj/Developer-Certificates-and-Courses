Have you ever worked on a document, 

made changes to it, 

and wished you could have gone back to 

your first version a few days later? 

Can you remember that feeling of 

wishing you could travel back in time? 

For developers, this time machine 

exists and it's called version control. 

In this video, you'll learn about version controls, 

primary features, and benefits. 

Version control is a system that records 

all changes and modifications to 

files for tracking purposes. 

Developers also use the term source control 

or source code management. 

The primary goal of 

any version control system is to keep track of changes. 

It achieves this by allowing developers 

access to the entire change history 

with the ability to revert or roll back 

to a previous state or point in time. 

There are different types of changes, 

such as adding new files, 

modifying or updating files, and deleting files. 

The version control system is 

the source of truth across all code, 

assets, and the team itself. 

Let me give you an example that we're all familiar with. 

In word processing applications, 

version control functionality is available to provide 

users with the safety net of auto-saving the document. 

The application creates a restoration point on 

each auto-save to which the user can revert if required. 

Version control systems for 

coding projects tend to be a bit more complex, 

but their underlying functionality 

follows the same process. 

Working as a developer, 

you need to become familiar with many different tools, 

and version control is one of them. 

For developers, especially those working in a team, 

there are many benefits associated with version control. 

These include; revision history, 

identity, collaboration, automation, and efficiency. 

Let's explore these in some more detail. 

Revision history provides a record 

of all changes in a project. 

It provides developers with the ability to revert to 

a stable point in time in cases where 

code edits cause issues or bugs. 

The ability to roll back to a particular version or time 

allows teams to work faster and 

deliver code with more confidence. 

Keeping a record of changes is great, 

but it doesn't have as much value if you don't know who 

is responsible for adding or changing a record. 

All changes made are always 

recorded with the identity of the user that made them. 

Combining this feature with the revision history 

allows teams to see not only when the changes occurred, 

but also who made the changes. 

Teams can also analyze the editing, 

creation, and the deletion of 

files on the control system. 

As a software developer, 

you will often work with a team to achieve a common goal. 

This can be adding new features to 

an existing project or creating a brand new service. 

In all cases, a version control system 

allows the team to 

submit their code and keep track 

of any changes that need to be made. 

Another important aspect of 

a version control system is 

something called a peer review. 

Developers working on a task create 

a peer review once the code is ready for inspection. 

The peer review aims to get other developers on 

your team to review the code and 

provide feedback where necessary. 

The ability to create and deliver code on 

a wide scale is complex and time-consuming. 

Version control helps keep track of all changes. 

It plays an integral role in 

the explosion of development operations, 

or DevOps, as it's commonly called. 

DevOps is a set of practices, philosophies, 

and tools that increase 

an organization's ability to deliver 

applications or services to a high quality and velocity. 

Version control is a key tool in this process, 

and it is used not only to track all changes but also 

to aid in software quality release and deployments. 

You as a developer, 

will usually work on a project alongside 

many developers and team members with other skill sets. 

You and your team need to be 

efficient to make your project a success. 

You and your team may work using 

processes from the agile methodology. 

In an agile process, 

a team normally plan and 

execute two weeks of work to complete, 

which is called an iteration. 

Each iteration has a list of tasks 

to complete before the two weeks ends. 

These tasks, while complex in some cases, 

are aided by having version control in place. 

If you would like to learn more 

about the agile methodology, 

there is a link to an additional reading 

at the end of this lesson. 

Testing and having some level of automation on 

every task introduced allows 

the team to be more efficient. 

It also ensures more confidence that any new feature 

being introduced will not break any existing flows. 

You now know what 

version control is all about. Great work. 

Now that you have a better understanding of 

the goals and benefits of version control, 

you are ready to learn how to start using it.
