In this course, you were 

introduced to the practice of version control. 

Let's do a brief recap of what you covered. 

In the first module, 

you learned about how different version control systems 

and effective software development workflows 

enable modern software developers to 

collaborate across the world 

without messing up each other's code. 

You gained knowledge about the history of 

version control and know how version control or 

subversion is used to bring order 

to the chaos of massive software projects, 

they have the potential for mistakes and bugs. 

Next, you learned more about the various systems, 

tools and methodologies that are leveraged by 

software developers to collaborate 

successfully as part of a global team. 

You've explored how to resolve conflicts in Git, 

and that version control plays 

a crucial part in the development of software. 

You then moved down to investigate 

the difference between staging and production, 

and that a staging environment should 

mimic your production environment. 

In Module 2, you learned about how to use 

the command line to execute commands in Linux. 

You were introduced to what the command line 

is and learn to use commands that traverse, 

create, rename, and delete files on your hard drive. 

Then you learned how easy it is to use piping and 

redirection to create powerful workflows 

that will automate your work, 

saving you time and effort. 

Finally, you explored the command line 

further, discovering standard input, 

output streams, flags that can be 

used to change the behavior of a command and grab. 

In Module 3, you developed 

a strong conceptual understanding of 

the Git technology and how it is used in 

software development projects to manage team files. 

First, you learned how to 

install Git on various operating systems, 

and then how to connect to Git Hub via 

HTTPS and SSH before creating a GitHub account. 

Next, you gained 

a practical understanding of how Git works, 

including creating and cloning a repository, 

add, commit, push and pull. 

You also explored how to use 

a repository in some concepts 

associated with workflows such as 

branches, blame, and forking. 

Finally, the ungraded lab is an opportunity to complete 

a practical version control exercise 

by forking a repository, 

creating a branch and committing a change. 

It also includes staging your changes and 

opening a pull request with a source repo. 

Well done on completing this recap. 

Now it's time to put into 

practice all that you've learned. 

Are you ready to proceed? Good luck.
