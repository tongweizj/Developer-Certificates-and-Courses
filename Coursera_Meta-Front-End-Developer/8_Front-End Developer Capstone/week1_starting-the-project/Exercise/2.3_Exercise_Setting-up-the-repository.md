Exercise: Setting up the repository
===================================

**Overview**
============

In earlier courses in the Front-End Developer program, including [React BasicsOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/home/welcome) and [Advanced ReactOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/home/week/1), you used create-react-app to build your own starter, boilerplate React projects. This means that, by now, you should be quite familiar with setting up a React project using VS Code and the create-react-app npm package. Furthermore, you should also understand version control best practices and be able to track and manage changes to your code. In this exercise and exercises to come, you will integrate this understanding and further expand your skillset, starting with setting up a repository with GitHub.

The following resources may help you complete this exercise:

**Scenario**
============

It's time for you to start building the web application for the Little Lemon website. You’ll begin by setting up the project on your local machine and tracking it with Git.

**Instructions**
================

Step 1: Setup a new React app using create-react-app
----------------------------------------------------

*   Navigate to a folder on your machine where you want Little Lemon restaurant’s web app to live.
    
*   Start a new React project inside the chosen folder using the npm init react-app my-app command, where my-app is the name of your choice.
    
*   For assistance, refer to the "Opening the built-in VS Code terminal and running npm init react-app command" section in the [Setting up a React project in VS CodeOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/QjCEc/setting-up-a-react-project-in-vs-code-optional) lesson item from the React Basics course.
    

**Step 2: Add a new repository on GitHub**
------------------------------------------

*   Navigate to your GitHub account.
    

**Tip:** If you need to create an account, refer to the [Create your GitHub accountOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/supplement/AJsQp/create-your-github-account) lesson item.

*   Inside the GitHub account, create a new repository.

*   Once the new repository window displays, note the URL of the repository.
    

Step 3: Use the git command to push to your repository
------------------------------------------------------

Once you’ve built the starter app using create-react-app, navigate to the directory using the command line. You will need to push your files to the repository on GitHub.

*   Run the git init command to initialize the repository.
    
*   Use the git add command to stage your files for commit.
    
*   Use the git commit command to commit your staged changes.
    

**Tip:** You may refer to the [Add and commitOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/UADXz/add-and-commit) lesson item in the Version Control course for further assistance.

*   Use the git remote command to add a remote for the repository on GitHub.
    

**Tip:** If you’re unsure of the remote URL, view the repository on GitHub and it will provide you with the relevant information.

*   Use the git push command to push the commits to the remote repository.
    

**Tip:** Refer to the [Push and pullOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/N4dUy/push-and-pull) lesson item for further assistance.

*   Run the git status command, then the git log command to confirm that Git is tracking your project locally and that you have the correct Git user set up.
    
*   Log on to GitHub and check that your commits are visible on the repository
    

**Conclusion**

You have completed all the steps necessary to set up your project's Git. You can now push every new commit to the remote origin and share your project's code with the world.

Exercise: Setting up the React project
======================================

Overview
--------

You previously discovered that instead of building a new React project from scratch, you can cut down on the initial steps by starting from a boilerplate project. However, you’ll first want to set up a few things to make this a streamlined process. In this exercise, you will set up a React project and tweak the resulting default boilerplate.

Scenario
--------

So far, you have been preparing to create the reserve-a-table function for the Little Lemon website. As a part of this process, it is now time to set up your React project properly.

**Note:** Before you begin, this exercise assumes that you are using the VS Code editor as your editor of choice. However, it is possible to use other editors to achieve similar results. If you are using another editor, you may use this exercise as a pointer and demonstration of how things are done in VS Code.

VS Code comes with many extensions that can help you when developing applications in any kind of technology and React is no different. There are numerous extensions that you have available at your disposal to make your React development a smoother and more efficient experience. In the steps that follow, you'll set up a few React-specific extensions, including:

*   **ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native**
    
*   **Auto Rename Tag** 
    
*   **Trailing Spaces** 
    

You’ll also clean up your starter app’s code.

Instructions
------------

### Step 1: Setup the ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native VS Code extension

Add the [ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native VS Code extensionOpens in a new tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets). This extension provides you with JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features for VS Code.

### Step 2: Setup the Auto Rename Tag VS Code extension

Add the [Auto Rename Tag VS Code extensionOpens in a new tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag). This extension makes it possible to automatically rename the paired HTML/XML tag as Visual Studio IDE does.

### Step 3: Setup the Trailing Spaces VS Code extension

Add the [Trailing Spaces VS Code extensionOpens in a new tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces). This extension allows you to highlight and delete trailing spaces. It’s also useful when working with Git to help you spot accidental whitespace addictions more easily and prevent unnecessary commits.

### Step 4: Create the React project

Use create-react-app to create the Little Lemon project.

**Tip:** Refer to the previous recap reading for guidelines.

### Step 5: Remove the starter app's boilerplate code from App.js

*   Open the project in Visual Studio Code. create-react-app generates some code in the App.js file that we will not need for the project.
    
*   Remove all the code in between the returned div with the classname of App.
    
*   Add some text in between the opening and closing div tags, such as Homepage, for the time being.
    

### Step 6: Remove the starter app's logo.svg file

Delete the logo.svg file from the app and delete its import from the App.js file.

**Conclusion**
--------------

By completing this exercise, you have set up and altered the default boilerplate React project in preparation to build the full application. Well done.
