The design phase is where designers turn the facts and information from the planning stage into reality

This stage must produce design structures and sketches for approval and testing

Then follows the development phase where coding and programming tasks are completed, as well as testing

This phase essentially involves the implementation of the results acquired during the previous step

In your case, producing a functional website or mobile application, the product is delivered during the launch phase

You will start by exploring UX and learning how following the UX process will enable you to solve the issue with the online booking feature of the Little Lemon website

Resolving these issues will likely increase sales and keep customers coming back for more

Keep in mind that because a product can constantly be improved, UX is an iterative process where post-launch feature testing and improvements will last indefinitely

There isn't a specific design process for UI, but it's still crucial

When it's done correctly, consumers usually don't even notice it

But if it's not, they will have a negative experience and most will leave the site and not come back

To clarify the purpose of UI and UX, an example of a fantastic UI and bad UX is something that looks lovely, but it's challenging to use

While something that is incredibly usable but unpleasant to look at is an example of a great UX and poor UI

You will now be taken through the steps to create both a fantastic UX and UI for the reserve a table function in this lesson via readings, exercises and quizzes
