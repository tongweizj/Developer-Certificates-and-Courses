Recap: Version control
======================

**Overview**
------------

To simulate a real-world project, you will build the Little Lemon React app using version control. In this reading, you will recap the concept of version control to progress with your React app. For assessment in the capstone project, you must use version control to keep track of your code changes and download the starter code for the Little Lemon app from a GitHub repository. It’s important to note that you should use the GitHub account you created for earlier courses.

**What is version control?**
----------------------------

Recall that version control is a way to track changes made to your project's code over time. To work with version control, you must work with the command line or terminal to type commands using Git.  Additionally, you need to be familiar with some of the basics of GitHub, such as setting up a GitHub account, connecting to GitHub, adding a new repository and cloning a repository.

**Conclusion**
--------------

In this reading, you revisited the concepts of version control, Git and GitHub. You are now prepared for the next lesson item, which is an exercise in setting up a repository for your project. Once you have completed the capstone project, you will be equipped with the skills to push your code to a GitHub repository for showcasing in a portfolio.
