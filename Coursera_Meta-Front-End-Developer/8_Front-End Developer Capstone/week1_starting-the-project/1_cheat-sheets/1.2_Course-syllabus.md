This course consists of four modules:

**Module 1: Starting the project**
----------------------------------

This introductory module will give you some general information about the capstone project. You'll also review the process of setting up your coding environment, tracking your code using Git and setting up your UX/UI processes. The purpose is to guide you through setting up and beginning your work on the project.
这个介绍性模块将为您提供有关顶点项目的一些一般信息。 您还将回顾设置编码环境、使用 Git 跟踪代码以及设置 UX/UI 流程的过程。 目的是指导您设置并开始项目工作。

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

*   Ensuring that your development environment is working and is set up to be as efficient as possible
    
*   Ensuring that you're tracking your project using version control, specifically Git and GitHub
    
*   Planning the UX/UI, including project wireframing, creating a component and applying design fundamentals in Figma
规划 UX/UI，包括项目线框图、创建组件以及在 Figma 中应用设计基础知识   

**Module 2: Project foundations**
---------------------------------

The second module of this course begins with a revision of semantic HTML. You'll need to set up a semantic HTML structure for your app. As styling your apps is essential, in this module, you'll also need to write some CSS code, including setting up a reusable CSS grid. Styling is closely related to components; thus, this module will guide you in setting up your project's components.
本课程的第二个模块从语义 HTML 的修订开始。 您需要为您的应用程序设置语义 HTML 结构。 由于设计应用程序的样式至关重要，因此在本模块中，您还需要编写一些 CSS 代码，包括设置可重用的 CSS 网格。 样式与组件密切相关； 因此，该模块将指导您设置项目的组件。

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

*   Setting up your project's HTML structure and styling
    
*   Setting up your project's components
    

**Module 3: Project functionality**
-----------------------------------

In this module, you'll focus on coding interactive parts of your app. You will complete your app's functionality, your app’s booking form with its own state, working with data and using APIs. Additionally, you'll improve the UX/UI of your app by further enhancing your users' experience through the evaluation and revision of its design. You will also address accessibility and form design.
在本模块中，您将重点关注应用程序交互部分的编码。 您将完成应用的功能、应用的预订表单及其自身状态、处理数据和使用 API。 
此外，您还可以通过评估和修改应用程序的设计来进一步增强用户体验，从而改进应用程序的 UX/UI。 您还将解决可访问性和表单设计问题。

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

*   Coding the table booking system, including state,
* 编码餐桌预订系统，包括状态，   
*   Working with forms to update your app's state through user input,
* 使用表单通过用户输入更新应用程序的状态，  
*   Adding unit tests to ensure your app works correctly as you code new features
* 添加单元测试以确保您的应用程序在编写新功能时正常工作 
*   Working with some in-browser APIs to ensure more persistent data      
* 使用一些浏览器内的API来确保更持久的数据  

**Module 4: Graded assessment**
-------------------------------

In this module, you will be assessed on the fundamental skills covered as you build the capstone project's functionality. You'll have a chance to compare your code and your designs with your peers via a peer review, as well as work through a solution to some of the most challenging parts of the capstone project. At the end of this module, you'll complete a graded assessment, reflect on your learning and be guided to the next steps in your developer journey.

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

*   A peer-review of some of your peers' projects
    
*   A graded assessment in which you synthesize the skills from this course
    
*   A reflection on your learning and the next steps in your developer journey
