Checking your development environment
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

In this reading, you'll recap fundamental concepts related to setting up your development environment correctly in preparation for developing the Little Lemon reserve-a-table web app functionality.

**General setup**
-----------------

To setup and check your development environment, you'll need to revisit several resources from other courses in this program:

*   [Programming with JavaScript: Setting up VS CodeOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/item/8fXsb) (note: only the VS Code setup part in the first half of the video is relevant to this course
    
*   [React Basics: Before you learn ReactOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/item/TM7JT) (note: this lesson item will be especially helpful if it's been a while since you've worked with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since you'll be working with all of these technologies alongside React, a refresher might be helpful for you.)
    
*   [Advanced React: Setting up a react project in VS CodeOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/supplement/Q3Ugj/setting-up-a-react-project-in-vs-code-optional)
    

**Conclusion**
--------------

In this reading, you recapped the process of ensuring your development environment is set up and ready to go, which you can apply to setting up the development environment for your project. Having all the necessary requirements sorted out and taken care of might prevent errors as you start developing your React app.
