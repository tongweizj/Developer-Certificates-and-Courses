# 3.3_Exercise_Setting-up-the-app-components

## Overview

In this exercise, you will set up the components and routing for the different areas of the Little Lemon website.

## Scenario

Now that the visual foundations of the Little Lemon website are set up, you’ll need to set up the components and routing for the functions and features of the website. 
Using component-based web development, you can code components that you can reuse throughout the Little Lemon website, for example, you could code the Nav component for the homepage of the website and re-use it for other pages, such as the About page and Bookings page. 
For more information on this approach to web development, you may find it helpful to revisit the following lesson items in the Introduction to Front-end development course:

## Instructions

### Step 1: Recognize components to build, using your design

Map, 1-to-1, the components you have in Figma. 
Here is an example of the components that could be built for the web app's homepage layout:

- Nav (the top-level navigation of the website, sometimes referred to as the navbar)

- CallToAction (sometimes referred to as the jumbotron or the hero, this component is the call-to-action section that guides the user to click a call-to-action button while enticing them to do so in as few words as possible)
CallToAction（有时称为大屏幕或英雄，此组件是号召性用语部分，引导用户单击号召性用语按钮，同时吸引他们用尽可能少的文字进行操作）

- Homepage (the component for the homepage)

- Specials (the component that loops over the specials that come from a data source)

- CustomersSay (testimonials, including star ratings, customer images and customer details)

- Chicago (the component that describes the Little Lemon Chicago restaurant and gives a short backstory for it)

- BookingPage (the component for the table reservations page)

## Step 2: Set up the Navigation

Now that your components are set up, the next step is to add the navigation and routes. 

- Update the hyperlinks in your navbar to use the Link component.

- In the Main component you created in the previous exercise, add the Routes component and define a route for each page. For example:
```js
<Routes> 
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />}></Route>
    <Route path="/booking" element={<BookingPage />}></Route>
</Routes>
```

## Step 3: Code the first version of the homepage's components

Now that you've identified the components that your homepage needs to have, code some simple components for the page.

Note: At this point, all that you need to have are the images and text.

## Step 4: Style the homepage components

Style the components that you've coded for the homepage using the style guide. 
You may choose to style the following using CSS rules that you’ve previously created, or, update the rules as necessary.

- Font size

- Color

- Background

- Line-height

- Letter-spacing

- Grid

- Flex

- Display

- Border

- Border radius

Note: Keep in mind that you may need to set aside sufficient time for styling. Styling these components will take some time, maybe even a few hours.

Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you have built and styled-components for the homepage of the Little Lemon website. You can apply these skills to creating component-based layouts for the Little Lemon reserve-a-table functionality.
