# 3.2_Recap: React basics

## Overview

Having worked through the two React-focused courses in this Front-End developer program, you are likely to know that React is all about components and that components rely heavily on the JSX syntax. 
In this reading, you’ll be guided through a quick recap of the basic building blocks of React.

## What is React?

React is a declarative and component-based JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. 
React 是一个声明性的、基于组件的 JavaScript 库，用于构建用户界面。

It allows you to build components and compose them together. 
它允许您构建组件并将它们组合在一起。

This feature, namely, the composability of React components, is very important because it allows you to construct React apps similar to how you'd create a structure with toy blocks. 
Simply put, it's a process that allows the construction of complex structures from simple building blocks.
这个功能，即 React 组件的可组合性，非常重要，因为它允许您构建 React 应用程序，就像使用玩具块创建结构一样。
简而言之，这是一个允许从简单的构建块构建复杂结构的过程。

## React components

In modern React, every React component is a JavaScript function. 
To differentiate between regular HTML elements and custom React components, you need to capitalize the component function's name. 
Then, using JSX syntax, you can render a component from another component. 
JSX syntax relies on expressions and ternary operators.
在现代 React 中，每个 React 组件都是一个 JavaScript 函数。
为了区分常规 HTML 元素和自定义 React 组件，您需要将组件函数的名称大写。
然后，使用 JSX 语法，您可以从另一个组件渲染一个组件。
JSX 语法依赖于表达式和三元运算符。

## Rendering components

For a component to be rendered (displayed) on a screen, it needs to be imported into another component. 
A component that imports another component is known as the parent component. 
The component that gets imported and rendered is referred to as a child component. 

You can render multiple components from the parent component and pass data from a parent component to a child component using props.
对于要在屏幕上渲染（显示）的组件，需要将其导入到另一个组件中。
导入另一个组件的组件称为父组件。
导入和呈现的组件称为子组件。

您可以从父组件渲染多个组件，并使用 props 将数据从父组件传递到子组件。

For example, suppose you have a parent component named App, which imports a child component named Header:

```js
import React from "react";
import Header from "./Header";

export default function App() {
    return (
        <Header />
    )
}

```

The Header component returns some HTML with the heading element containing some text.

```js
export default function Header() {
    return (
        <div className="main-grid">
            <h1>This is the Header</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Props, state and event handlers

There are two ways that components work with data: **props and state**. 
If the data comes from a parent component, that data comes in the form of props. 
Props are immutable and external to a component, meaning they come from outside a component. 
State is mutable and internal to a component, meaning it exists inside a component.
组件处理数据的方式有两种：**props 和 state**。
如果数据来自父组件，则该数据以 props 的形式出现。
道具是不可变的并且位于组件外部，这意味着它们来自组件外部。
状态是可变的并且是组件内部的，这意味着它存在于组件内部。

Event handlers are a way to update state. 
Event handlers in React work similarly to the event attributes in plain HTML. 
There are several differences between the two syntaxes, but the two main ones are:
事件处理程序是更新状态的一种方法。
React 中的事件处理程序的工作方式与纯 HTML 中的事件属性类似。
两种语法之间存在一些差异，但两个主要差异是：

- HTML event attributes use lowercase; React event attributes use camelCase.
- HTML event attributes use parentheses; React event attributes don't use parentheses.
- HTML事件属性使用小写； React 事件属性使用驼峰命名法。
- HTML 事件属性使用括号； React 事件属性不使用括号。
## Conclusion

In this reading, you revisited the topic of React basics. 
Now that you've re-acquainted yourself with some of the basic React concepts, you are better prepared to take on your next exercise, which will involve setting up components for your project app.
