Exercise: Adding table booking state
====================================

**Overview**
------------

Previously, you set up the BookingForm component and tracked its state. However, to be truly functional, your Little Lemon reserve-a-table web app functionality will need to be able to share state across components.
之前，您设置了 BookingForm 组件并跟踪其状态。
然而，要真正发挥作用，您的 Little Lemon 预订餐桌 Web 应用程序功能需要能够跨组件共享状态。

**Scenario**
------------

The goal of this exercise is for you to expand the implementation of the component for the Booking page of the Little Lemon website. 
本练习的目标是让您扩展 Little Lemon 网站预订页面组件的实现。

As part of the reserve-a-table web app functionality,
作为预订餐桌 Web 应用程序功能的一部分，
the page will display 
- the existing booked table times 
- and available slots, 
using a list component containing several instances of a BookingSlot component. 
该页面将使用包含已经预约和没有预约的时间。
用一个列表组件来包含了一组 bookingSlot 组件

Available booking slots will be shared between the components and updated when the user submits the form. 
可用的预订时段将在组件之间共享，并在用户提交表单时更新。
As your progress through the exercise, it may be worth revising the following lesson items in the **Advanced React** course:
随着练习的进展，可能值得修改 **高级 React** 课程中的以下课程项目：

*   [Working with React hooks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/lecture/7Fb8U/working-with-react-hooks)

*   Lifting up state

*   [Working with complex data in useState](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/item/MlOnL)
*   [What is useReducer and how it differs from useState](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/item/gSMJb)

**Instructions**
----------------

### **Step 1: Life state up to the Main component**
第 1 步：主要组件的生命状态
As you added the table booking state to the BookingForm component in the previous exercise, 
由于您在上一个练习中将餐桌预订状态添加到 BookingForm 组件
in this exercise, you need to lift the state up to the Main component. This is the preferred approach in this case, as your app is relatively simple.
，因此在本练习中，您需要将状态提升到 Main 组件。
在这种情况下，这是首选方法，因为您的应用程序相对简单。

*   Move the availableTimes useState hook from the BookingForm component into the Main component
将 availableTimes useState 挂钩从 BookingForm 组件移至 Main 组件

*   Pass down the state and state changing functions from the Main component to the BookingForm component using props in order to make state work across different components.
使用 props 将状态和状态更改函数从 Main 组件传递到 BookingForm 组件，以便使状态在不同组件之间起作用。

### **Step 2: Update** BookingForm **to display available times based on the selected date**

*   The next step is to prepare the available times to be updated based on the date the user has selected. To do this, you will change the availableTimes state to a reducer.
    
*   In the Main component, create a function named updateTimes which will handle the state change. This function will change the availableTimes based on the selected date. For now, the function can return the same available times regardless of the date.
    
*   Next, create a function called initializeTimes which will create the initial state for the availableTimes.
    
*   Then, change availableTimes to a reducer using the useReducer function and provide the two previous functions as parameters.
    
*   Update the BookingForm component to dispatch the state change when the date form field is changed.
    

**Tip:** Include the newly selected date in the dispatch parameter.

**Conclusion**
--------------

By completing this exercise, you should now have an app for Little Lemon in which state works across several components, moving you another step closer to having a fully-functional booking page.

Although outside the scope of this capstone project, it’s worth mentioning that you may favor more robust state management approaches in the case of larger or more complex apps.
