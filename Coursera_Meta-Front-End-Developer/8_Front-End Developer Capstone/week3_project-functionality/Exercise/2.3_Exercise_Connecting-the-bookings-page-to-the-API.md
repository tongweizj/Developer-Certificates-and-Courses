# Exercise: Connecting the bookings page to the API

## **Overview**

In this exercise, you will connect the Bookings page of the Little Lemon restaurant to the API.

## **Scenario**

Now that the Booking page is set up, you need to make sure that customers do not reserve a table that has already been reserved. 
- Double booking a table would lead to a poor customer experience. 

By updating the web app to retrieve the available booking times for an API, you can help ensure that Little Lemon’s customers can reserve a table without issue. 

The goal of this exercise is for you to work with data in your Little Lemon restaurant app by connecting the Bookings page to the booking API. 

As you progress through the exercise, the following lesson items from the **Advanced React** course are worth revisiting:

-   [What are side effects?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/item/bziSe)
-   [Data fetching using hooks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/item/EBtFp)

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set up the API library**

To prepare for the completion of this exercise, you need to include the API JavaScript file in your code.

-   Add the following code to your index.html.

```js
```
<script src\="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meta-Front-End-Developer-PC/capstone/master/api.js"\></script\>
```


-   The API has two functions that you can use in your code:
    
    -   fetchAPI(date) - This function accepts a date as a parameter and returns an array of available reservation times for the provided date
        
    -   submitAPI(formData) - This function accepts the booking form data as a parameter and will return true if the data was successfully submitted.
        

### **Step 2: Update the booking form to display the available times from the API**

-   Update the initializeTimes function that you previously created to use the fetchData API function to return the available times for today’s date.
    

**Tip:** You can create a Date object to represent today’s date.

-   Update the updateTimes function that you previously created to use the fetchData API function. Remember, you dispatched the selected date to the updateTimes function. This should be passed to the fetchData function as a parameter.
    

**Step 3: Test the behavior**

Run your web app and check that the available times on the booking form change when you select a different date.

## **Conclusion**

By completing this exercise, the Bookings page of your app is connected to an API and the customer now has an improved experience of the Little Lemon restaurant.
