# Coding Interview Preparation

## Week1-Introduction to the coding interview

In this introductory module, you'll learn about a coding interview, what it could consist of, and the types of coding interviews you might encounter. You’ll learn about how to prepare for a coding interview, focusing on communication and working with pseudocode. You will also get an introduction to computer science, including the fundamental concepts of Binary, Big O notation, and time and space complexity.
