# 1.2_Introduction to the technical recruitment process

It takes approximately 39 months to find software engineers and developers in tech hub cities in the US.

The interviews that you will go through sometimes have skills that you don't normally use in your day to day job.

It's not just about how well you can program, it's also about how well you're displaying a lot of interpersonal skills, how well you're able to drive projects, how well you're able to collaborate with others.
在美国科技中心城市寻找软件工程师和开发人员大约需要 39 个月的时间。
您将要经历的面试有时会包含您在日常工作中通常不会使用的技能。
这不仅关系到您的编程能力如何，还关系到您如何展示人际交往能力、您推动项目的能力以及与他人协作的能力。

You don't need to worry about showing up in a suit.
You really can just kind of wear whatever be yourself, and focus on the technical aspects of the interview.
您无需担心穿着西装出现。
你真的可以穿任何你自己的衣服，并专注于面试的技术方面。


Hi, my name is Julie, and I am a software engineer on the IG shopping team at Meta New York.
Hi my name is Moxxy Herrera.
I use they/them pronouns, I'm a software engineer in the social impact award and Meta, and I work at the Menlo Park office.
My name is Chanel Johnson.

I work remotely in Maryland for Meta, and I'm a software engineer for the Facebook app core architecture team, where we work on infrastructure for the Facebook mobile app.

My name is Mari Butilando, I am a software engineer for the Web3 Monetization team within Meta, and I work on different ways creators and influencers can make a living off of the Facebook platform using Web3 technologies like NFTs and Cryptocurrency.

I think it can be broken up into three general areas.

One is the application process, one is actual interviewing, and one is the calibration process when they discuss your packet and give you an offer.

In terms of the actual interview process, it's broken up into **technical architecture, and behavioral**.

For the application phase, its recruiters kind of screening your resume, your work experience.

The recruiter then will meet with you and talk with you, or to get a better idea about your skills, your experiences, what you're looking for to make sure that you're a good fit for the role.
我认为它可以分为三个一般领域。
- 一个是申请过程
- 一个是实际面试
- 一个是他们讨论你的包裹并给你报价时的校准过程。

就实际面试过程而言，它分为技术架构和行为。
在申请阶段，招聘人员会筛选你的简历和工作经验。
然后，招聘人员会与您会面并与您交谈，或者更好地了解您的技能、您的经验、您的需求，以确保您适合该职位。

Phase two is the technical aspect of it.

There can be a range of 1 to 4 or 5 or even more interviews there.

So this could be things like a coder pad interview where you're on the phone or over a voice chat with a recruiter or a engineer to kind of go through some technical challenges.

You'll have some behavioral interviews, where people are just going to engaging with what it's like to work with you, how do you solve problems.
第二阶段是技术方面。

可能有 1 到 4 次或 5 次甚至更多采访。
因此，这可能是类似于程序员面试之类的事情，您可以通过电话或通过与招聘人员或工程师的语音聊天来解决一些技术挑战。
您将进行一些行为面试，人们会了解与您一起工作的感觉，以及您如何解决问题。

And then oftentimes their architecture interviews as well, where you build kind of an end to end products, discuss the full architecture for that.

Phase three, the final phase is when everyone involved in the process kind of gets together and discusses how you did throughout the phases, and if they should extend an offer to you.

If you decide to take on the offer, you go through what is called boot camp process, where you get to learn the ropes of how it is working at Meta.
然后通常也会进行架构采访，在其中构建端到端产品，讨论完整的架构。
第三阶段，即最后阶段，参与该过程的每个人都聚集在一起，讨论您在整个阶段中的表现，以及他们是否应该向您提供报价。
如果您决定接受这个提议，您将经历所谓的训练营流程，在这里您可以了解 Meta 的运作方式。

And also sit with the teams that you're interested in, so that you know what choice you end up making, and you get to choose ultimately what team you go in.
If you are interviewing for a specific pipeline like IOS, android, or ML, or AI, you should expect some questions that deal with that specific domain.
还要与你感兴趣的团队坐在一起，这样你就知道你最终会做出什么选择，并且你可以最终选择你加入的团队。
如果您正在面试特定流程（例如 IOS、Android、机器学习或人工智能），您应该会遇到一些涉及该特定领域的问题。

So, for example, in my case, I was interviewing for the IOS pipeline.

So in addition to those algorithms and data structure questions that I got asked, I also got asked some IOS questions, or some questions that I deal with in my day to day work as an IOS engineer.

So you can imagine similar things as if you were a an android engineer or if you're an AI or ML engineer.
I think in the application phase is when a lot of candidates get screened out, what can really help there is crafting your resume and focusing on real experience, that will really help when it comes to software engineering roles.
例如，就我而言，我正在面试 IOS 管道。
因此，除了我被问到的算法和数据结构问题之外，我还被问到了一些 IOS 问题，或者是我作为 IOS 工程师在日常工作中处理的一些问题。
因此，您可以想象类似的事情，就像您是一名 Android 工程师，或者您是一名 AI 或 ML 工程师一样。
我认为在申请阶段，当很多候选人被筛选出来时，**真正能有所帮助的是精心制作你的简历并关注真实的经验，这对于软件工程职位来说确实很有帮助**。

So, if you don't have job experience, totally fine, work on side projects and that will show both concrete experience and a drive that you're actually interested in working on the role that you're applying for.

I will see the coding interview portion is where a lot of people get disqualified.

There's going to be many reasons for it, but the biggest reason I see is that sometimes when you're writing out your code, the person being interviewed is not explaining their thought process, what's going on, they're not asking clarifying questions.

因此，如果您没有工作经验，完全没问题，可以从事业余项目，这将显示出具体的经验和动力，表明您实际上对您所申请的职位感兴趣。
我会看到编码面试部分是很多人被取消资格的地方。
造成这种情况的原因有很多，但我认为最大的原因是，有时当你编写代码时，接受采访的人没有解释他们的思维过程，发生了什么，他们没有提出澄清问题。

Sometimes the interviewer gives them a hint they're not listening.

So, communication skills is where I also see a lot of people getting disqualified in the coding interview portion.
Some candidates I see do not have a structured process for answering problems they may not have heard or seen before.

And they kind of just go cowboy coding and just start coding without even knowing what they're supposed to solve.

So I think having a robust problem solving process for questions you may or may not have seen before, is very important doing well in in these coding interviews.
有时面试官会暗示他们没有在听。

因此，我也看到很多人在编码面试部分被取消资格的地方是沟通技巧。
我看到的一些候选人没有一个结构化的流程来回答他们以前可能没有听说过或见过的问题。

他们就像牛仔编码一样，甚至不知道自己要解决什么问题就开始编码。

因此，我认为对于您以前可能见过或可能没有见过的问题，拥有一个强大的问题解决过程对于在这些编码面试中取得好成绩非常重要。

One common problem is people get stuck and they get so wrapped up in it, that they're unable to kind of take feedback.

What interviewers are looking for, isour holistic approach to the problem.

So it's not just about solving the problem, it's about how you go about it, it's about collaboration with the interviewer.

So that's a really important piece to remember.
一个常见的问题是人们陷入困境，他们陷入其中，无法接受反馈。
面试官正在寻找的是我们解决问题的整体方法。
所以这不仅仅是解决问题的问题，而是你如何解决问题的问题，以及与面试官的合作。
所以这是一个需要记住的非常重要的部分。

>> The biggest thing that I've learned is to really be myself.

I found it much more successful and way less stressful to just be who I am unapologetically.

But it also means whenever I come forward as a candidate, like I am presenting myself as I am and not trying to hide anything given that this is who I want to be at work, this is who I want to be in my life.

And I think having that mentality has made it so much easier, regardless of the outcome of the process.
Think really hard about what you want, and choose companies that resonate with what you value.

There are other things other than compensation and just the prestige of a company that matters, and how happy you are with the company.

So make sure you make a list of those, and consider that whenever you're choosing companies.

My biggest piece of advice is just going through as much practice as possible.

我发现毫无歉意地做自己会更成功，压力也更小。
但这也意味着，每当我作为候选人出现时，我都会展现自己的本来面目，而不是试图隐藏任何东西，因为这就是我在工作中想成为的人，这就是我在生活中想成为的人。

我认为，无论过程的结果如何，拥有这种心态都会让事情变得容易得多。
认真思考你想要什么，然后选择与你所看重的东西产生共鸣的公司。
除了薪酬之外，还有其他因素很重要，公司的声誉以及你对公司的满意度也很重要。
因此，请务必列出这些内容，并在选择公司时考虑这一点。
我最大的建议就是尽可能多地练习。

So, two main ways to do that, I think is one while you go through lead code problems or mock interviewing, doing the whole thing and to end.

Even if you're unable to solve the problem, you get stuck, you don't know what to do, finishing it out as if it's a real interview.

It'll give you really good practice for when you actually get to the interview.

And then the second thing is apply to as many places as possible.
因此，我认为有两种主要方法可以做到这一点，一种是在你解决潜在代码问题或模拟面试时，完成整个事情并结束。
即使你无法解决问题，你也会陷入困境，你不知道该怎么做，就像真正的面试一样完成它。
当你真正参加面试时，它会给你很好的练习。
第二件事是应用到尽可能多的地方。

It gives you the best chance of getting interviews, and then once you're in a real life interview situation, it's a lot easier if you've already had experience doing that before.

It really helps calm the nerves, and it it helps you get more practice in.

There's not all just only like one particular person we're looking for when it comes to tech.

We want different backgrounds and different perspectives and experiences, because that's the only way we're going to make our products better.

We need that, it's such a rewarding process to make an impact and actually for the better, and just meet with people and keep learning.

You will never get bored at this job, never.
它为您提供了获得面试的最佳机会，然后一旦您处于现实生活中的面试情况，如果您之前已经有过这样做的经验，那就容易多了。
它确实有助于平静神经，并且可以帮助您进行更多练习。
在技术方面，我们寻找的并不只是某个特定的人。
我们想要不同的背景、不同的观点和体验，因为这是我们让我们的产品变得更好的唯一方法。
我们需要这样，这是一个非常有益的过程，可以产生影响，实际上是为了更好，与人们见面并不断学习。
你永远不会对这份工作感到无聊，永远不会。
>> As you start to interview, you will face many ups and downs, and these are all experiences you can learn from.

If you keep pushing, keep learning, you will eventually get to a role where you can start an amazing career in technology.

The amount of preparation you're going to do, is going to lead you to having a really big impact in the world because software is just everywhere and it's used by millions and billions of people.

So, I think it's well worth the preparation, the amount of effort it takes to land a job at a very influential and impactful tech company.
如果您不断努力，不断学习，您最终将获得一个可以在技术领域开始令人惊叹的职业生涯的职位。

您要做的大量准备工作将使您对世界产生巨大的影响，因为软件无处不在，并且被数百万和数十亿人使用。

因此，我认为为了在一家非常有影响力和影响力的科技公司找到一份工作而付出的准备和努力是非常值得的。
