# 3.3_Memory

In a previous video bytes were introduced each byte consists of eight bits.

A bit is the simplest form of computing memory.

In this video you will learn about the central processing unit or the CPU and the roles and functions of the different types of memory.
在本视频中，您将了解中央处理器或 CPU 以及不同类型内存的角色和功能。

Typically a computer will be made up of a series of memory blocks which contain both information and instructions on how this information needs to be processed.
通常，计算机由一系列内存块组成，其中包含信息以及有关如何处理该信息的指令。

Memory capacity then refers to the number of bytes that a computer can hold.

There are different types of memory that need to be considered namely cache memory, main memory and secondary memory.

Firstly to better understand the various layers of memory it is important to pause and consider how a computer works.

A computer functions around the central processing unit or CPU this takes both information and some instructions on how this information is to be processed.

内存容量是指计算机可以容纳的字节数。
需要考虑不同类型的存储器，即高速缓冲存储器、主存储器和辅助存储器。
首先，为了更好地理解内存的各个层，暂停并考虑计算机的工作原理非常重要。
计算机围绕中央处理单元或 CPU 运行，它需要信息和一些关于如何处理该信息的指令

All this information exists as bytes or a series of ones and zeros that are determined by a small electrical current.

The CPU can work faster than information can be transferred to it.

Often a CPU will be working on a number of different tasks near simultaneously.

The switching between tasks can allow information to be transferred into the cache for processing and the results to be stored in the appropriate location.

所有这些信息都以字节或一系列由小电流确定的 1 和 0 形式存在。
CPU 的工作速度比向其传输信息的速度还要快。
通常，CPU 会几乎同时处理许多不同的任务。
任务之间的切换可以允许信息传输到缓存中进行处理，并将结果存储在适当的位置。

The proximity of a memory cell to the CPU can reduce the time it takes to load the information.

Therefore quicker and more expensive memory is always found near the CPU.

So an important concept to consider when discussing memory is the transfer rate.

This relates to the speed at which a computer can transfer memory into the cache for processing.

Now that you better understand the processing part let's explore the different types of memory and start with cache memory.



存储单元靠近 CPU 可以减少加载信息所需的时间。
因此，更快、更昂贵的内存总是位于 CPU 附近。
因此，在讨论内存时要考虑的一个重要概念是传输速率。
这与计算机将内存传输到高速缓存进行处理的速度有关。
现在您已经更好地了解了处理部分，让我们探索不同类型的内存并从高速缓存开始。

## 缓存

Cache memory is the most expensive form of memory and lives close to your CPU chip.
高速缓存是最昂贵的内存形式，并且靠近 CPU 芯片。

When the CPU receives an instruction to process some information, it first checks the cache to see if the information is here.

If the information is available in the cache, it is processed, if it fails to find the required information here, the information is not processed.

The CPU then queries the larger, slower main memory then loads this information into the cache for processing.

Storing recently accessed information in the cache can improve the effectiveness of your system by reducing the search and transfer time of regularly used data.

Much like a metro in a large metropolis cache memory is organized in zones of importance.

The most readily required information is in zone 1, each subsequent zone is of lesser importance and is numbered zone 2, 3, 4 and so on.

当CPU收到处理某些信息的指令时，它首先检查高速缓存，看看该信息是否在这里。
如果该信息在缓存中可用，则对其进行处理，如果此处未能找到所需信息，则不对该信息进行处理。
然后，CPU 查询较大、较慢的主内存，然后将此信息加载到高速缓存中进行处理。
将最近访问的信息存储在缓存中可以减少经常使用的数据的搜索和传输时间，从而提高系统的效率。

就像大都市中的地铁一样，高速缓冲存储器被组织在重要的区域中。

最容易需要的信息位于区域 1，每个后续区域的重要性较低，编号为区域 2、3、4 等。

## main memory

Next you will learn about main memory, a computer's main memory consists of **read access memory, RAM and read only memory, ROM.
**
Main memory holds only the information that a computer is currently working on.

It can be volatile or non-volatile, volatile memory stores information actively so if the computer loses power, it is lost.

Non-volatile memory retains its information when the power is cut.

ROM as the name suggests, is read only, meaning the information cannot be overwritten.

接下来您将了解主存储器，计算机的主存储器由读取存储器（RAM）和只读存储器（ROM）组成。
主存储器仅保存计算机当前正在处理的信息。
它可以是易失性的，也可以是非易失性的，易失性存储器会主动存储信息，因此如果计算机断电，信息就会丢失。

非易失性存储器在断电时仍保留其信息。

ROM，顾名思义，是只读的，这意味着信息不能被覆盖。

This memory is programmed once at the factory and cannot be altered.

Typically one will find instructions and data that are critical for a computer's function here.

ROM is busiest when the computer starts and information on the required application is loaded.

RAM is programmable, it can retain new information and instructions.

RAM holds the current data and instructions that are in current use.

The amount of RAM your computer has is directly correlated to how fast it can go.

This is because of the transfer rate.

该存储器在出厂时已编程一次，无法更改。
通常，人们会在这里找到对计算机功能至关重要的指令和数据。
当计算机启动并加载所需应用程序的信息时，ROM 最忙。
RAM是可编程的，它可以保留新的信息和指令。
RAM 保存当前使用的当前数据和指令。
计算机的 RAM 大小与其运行速度直接相关。
这是因为传输速率。

Large amounts of RAM mean that the system does not need to transfer information constantly.

Instead it can hold and run a number of applications at once using RAM.

All the memory needed to operate these applications needs to be available from your RAM.

Having too many programs open will affect the performance of your system by exhausting your RAM memory.

There are a number of algorithms for reading and storing these memory addresses that fall outside the perimeters of this course.

大量的RAM意味着系统不需要不断地传输信息。
相反，它可以使用 RAM 同时保存和运行多个应用程序。
运行这些应用程序所需的所有内存都需要从 RAM 中获得。
打开太多程序会耗尽 RAM 内存，从而影响系统性能。
有许多用于读取和存储这些内存地址的算法，这些算法超出了本课程的范围。

## 二级缓存
Now let's explore secondary memory in more depth.

Secondary memory relates to external memory that can be plugged in externally and used to increase the storage capacity of your system.

Accessing secondary memory is slower and requires transferring all required information and instructions into RAM.

Examples of secondary memory would include cloud storage, external hard drives and memory sticks.

In this video the various components of memory have been discussed.

You have learned how all memory allocation revolves around the CPU, which oversees the reading, processing and storing of information on the computer.

现在让我们更深入地探讨辅助存储器
辅助存储器涉及可以从外部插入并用于增加系统存储容量的外部存储器。
访问辅助存储器的速度较慢，并且需要将所有必需的信息和指令传输到 RAM 中。
辅助存储器的示例包括云存储、外部硬盘驱动器和记忆棒。
在此视频中讨论了内存的各个组成部分。
您已经了解了所有内存分配如何围绕 CPU 进行，CPU 负责监督计算机上信息的读取、处理和存储。

You have also learned how there are different types of memory that vary in speed and importance.
This informs their proximity to the CPU with quicker, more expensive memory cells found near the source.
This information should assist you in understanding how your computer works much better.

您还了解了不同类型的记忆在速度和重要性方面有何不同。
这表明它们与 CPU 的距离接近于在源附近发现的更快、更昂贵的存储单元。 
这些信息应该可以帮助您更好地了解计算机的工作原理。
