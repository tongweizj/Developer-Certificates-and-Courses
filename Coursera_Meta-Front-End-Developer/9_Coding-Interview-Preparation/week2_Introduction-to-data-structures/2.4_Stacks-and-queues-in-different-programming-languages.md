## Introduction

A stack is a fundamental data structure that limits the way data is stored in an application. Namely, items must adhere to the entry or exit policy of last-in-first-out. Different languages have different implementations, though overall, the general result is the same. A queue is very similar to a stack; however, the order of entry is different, favoring a first-in-first-out policy. 

In this reading, you will learn about some of the inherent differences in both stacks and queues across different programming languages.
堆栈是一种基本数据结构，它限制了应用程序中数据的存储方式。 即，物品必须遵守后进先出的进入或退出政策。 不同的语言有不同的实现，但总的来说，一般结果是相同的。 队列与堆栈非常相似； 然而，进入的顺序不同，有利于先进先出的政策。

在本文中，您将了解不同编程语言中堆栈和队列的一些固有差异。
## Stacks

Stacks are an example of an abstract data type. In computer science, this means that there are some very important characteristics that need to be enforced when implementing it, but there are no actual built-in versions that you can just import. For stacks, the important principle is LIFO or last-in-first-out. The analogy for stacks can be to visualize a pile of plates on a washing board. As each plate is cleaned, it is placed on top of the previous one. For drying them, each plate must be taken from the top. So, the last plate added to the pile is dried first, and the first plate on the pile is dried last. A common usage for stacks is to keep your browser history. Each time you hit back, the previously visited page loads and, going forward, then reads it to the pile.

A common implementation of a stack in JavaScript is through using an array and making sure that it acts only in a way that a stack would act. Taking a data structure and using it to build another type of data structure is said to use a container adapter. So here, the array is the container, and the adaptation forces it to behave as a stack should. The important features of a stack are push, pop, peek and count. Push adds an item to the top of the stack. Using an array means that the count must always know where on the array the last item went. Equally, for the pop method, having a count for the array is important, as pop only returns the last item entered on the stack.

堆栈是抽象数据类型的一个示例。 在计算机科学中，这意味着在实现它时需要强制执行一些非常重要的特征，但没有可以直接导入的实际内置版本。 对于堆栈来说，重要的原则是 LIFO 或后进先出。 堆栈的类比可以想象为洗衣板上的一堆盘子。 当每个盘子被清洁后，它被放置在前一个盘子的上面。 为了干燥它们，必须从顶部取出每个盘子。 因此，添加到堆中的最后一个盘子首先干燥，堆上的第一个盘子最后干燥。 堆栈的常见用途是保存浏览器历史记录。 每次您回击时，都会加载之前访问过的页面，然后继续将其读取到堆中。

JavaScript 中堆栈的常见实现是通过使用数组并确保它仅以堆栈的方式运行。 采用一种数据结构并使用它来构建另一种类型的数据结构称为使用容器适配器。 所以在这里，数组是容器，并且适应迫使它表现得像堆栈应该的那样。 堆栈的重要功能是入栈、出栈、查看和计数。 Push 将一个项目添加到堆栈顶部。 使用数组意味着计数必须始终知道数组中最后一项的位置。 同样，对于 pop 方法，数组的计数也很重要，因为 pop 只返回进入堆栈的最后一项。

## Queues

A queue, like a stack, is a linear data structure that retains the order in which things were entered. When one talks about a linear structure, it means that items are stored in the order in which they were added. Just like a stack, the queue has a strict implementation of how items are added and removed. While a stack implements a LIFO approach, queues work with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach. So, the first item that is added to the queue will be the first item that is removed. Like a customer queuing to make a purchase, queues look to implement a policy that places importance on the time of arrival. This has some real-world benefits when implementing things like CPU and disk scheduling, where it is important to deal with tasks as they arrive.

A queue is an abstract data type in Swift, which means that to use the functionality of a queue, you would first have to code up a structure that will act in that way. Two important terms associated with queues are enqueued (to add an item to the queue) and dequeue (to remove an item from the back of a list). The simplest approach for creating a queue is to use an array as the container adaptor. Because a queue only pops elements from the front of the queue, the look-up time will always be O(1), so any application built using this approach can expect very quick service. As with stacks, the available methods for a queue are kept minimal, with peak, pop, push and size being the most important ones.

Python implements several variant queue classes that are all synchronized. Synchronization is a computer science concept that means that all access to the data found there is managed so that the data structure can only be accessed by one process at a time. This is important when you think about cloud computing and having many different sources trying to look up and change data at the same time. On top of FIFO and LIFO, Python queue implementation includes a priority queue. A priority queue, as the name suggests, is about assigning importance to the elements found in the queue. So instead of a first-come-first-serve basis, service is based on importance. This is a bit like the VIP line at the concert.

队列与堆栈一样，是一种线性数据结构，它保留事物输入的顺序。 当人们谈论线性结构时，这意味着项目按照它们添加的顺序存储。 就像堆栈一样，队列对如何添加和删除项目有严格的实现。 堆栈采用 LIFO 方法，而队列则采用先进先出 (FIFO) 方法。 因此，添加到队列中的第一个项目将是第一个被删除的项目。 就像顾客排队购买一样，排队也希望实施一项重视到达时间的政策。 在实现 CPU 和磁盘调度等任务时，这具有一些现实的好处，在任务到达时对其进行处理非常重要。

队列是 Swift 中的一种抽象数据类型，这意味着要使用队列的功能，您首先必须编写一个以这种方式起作用的结构。 与队列相关的两个重要术语是入队（将项目添加到队列中）和出队（从列表后面删除项目）。 创建队列的最简单方法是使用数组作为容器适配器。 由于队列仅从队列前面弹出元素，因此查找时间始终为 O(1)，因此使用此方法构建的任何应用程序都可以获得非常快速的服务。 与堆栈一样，队列的可用方法保持最少，其中最重要的是peak、pop、push 和size。

Python 实现了多个同步的变体队列类。 同步是一种计算机科学概念，意味着对其中发现的数据的所有访问都受到管理，以便数据结构一次只能由一个进程访问。 当您考虑云计算并且有许多不同的源试图同时查找和更改数据时，这一点很重要。 除了 FIFO 和 LIFO 之外，Python 队列实现还包括一个优先级队列。 顾名思义，优先级队列是为队列中找到的元素分配重要性。 因此，服务不是以先到先服务为基础，而是以重要性为基础。 这有点像演唱会的VIP排队。
## Conclusion

Selecting the appropriate data structure for the appropriate task is a very important programming decision, as it can affect the entire project. You would select a stack when there is a need to keep track of the order in which an item is entered and to return them in a very specific way. A queue is used for maintaining order, but it will abide by different rules than a stack. Finally, if you want a data structure where you can assign importance, then a priority queue is worth looking at.

为适当的任务选择适当的数据结构是一个非常重要的编程决策，因为它会影响整个项目。 当需要跟踪项目的输入顺序并以非常具体的方式返回它们时，您可以选择堆栈。 队列用于维护顺序，但它遵守与堆栈不同的规则。 最后，如果您想要一个可以分配重要性的数据结构，那么优先级队列值得考虑。
