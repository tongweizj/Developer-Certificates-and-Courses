# 2.1_Lists and sets

Have you ever needed to store some data, but were unsure about what data structure to use. 

It's a common coding problem. 

In this video, you will discover two important data structures that could be used. 

Lists and sets. 

Both a very useful data structures with their own strengths and weaknesses. 

Lists and sets are common in many programming languages. 
## lists

Let's get started by exploring lists. 

In most programming languages, lists are represented as objects. 

This means that in addition to storing data, they also have their own in-built methods. 
这意味着除了存储数据之外，它们还有自己的内置方法。
Here, an in-built sort method is used to arrange the numbers in a list. 
这里，使用内置的排序方法来排列列表中的数字。
As with arrays, it is common to find lists that are declared as either a string, an integer, or float. 
与数组一样，经常会发现声明为字符串、整数或浮点数的列表。

In some programming languages, you can have lists with mixed element types. 

A list is an abstract concept that refers to a container of elements. 
列表是一个抽象概念，指的是元素的容器。

A stable implementation of a list is done using either an array or a linked list. 
列表的稳定实现是使用数组或链表来完成的。

An array-based list is an ordered collection built using arrays as the underlying data structure. 
基于数组的列表是使用数组作为基础数据结构构建的有序集合。

As such, they are subject to the same strengths and limitations associated with arrays. 
因此，它们具有与阵列相同的优点和限制。

Array-based implementations relate to the initial sizing rather than simply pointing to another node as with a linked list. 
基于数组的实现与初始大小相关，而不是像链表那样简单地指向另一个节点。

Some languages require that you initially determine how big a structure will be, while others allow for dynamically growing structures. 
有些语言要求您最初确定结构有多大，而其他语言则允许动态增长的结构。

It should be noted that this freedom is somewhat surface level. 

For many dynamic structures, there is an initial size automatically configured at instantiation. 

When this limit is reached, the array will copy itself into a new structure with a larger size allocation. 

Therefore, the decision not to arbitrarily allocate space at the onset may come at a cost at runtime when such data structures may have to expand multiple times during the execution of other operations. 
因此，一开始就不任意分配空间的决定可能会在运行时付出代价，因为此类数据结构在执行其他操作期间可能必须多次扩展。

Consider the computation cost of a list dynamically growing while performing operations in a loop. 
考虑在循环中执行操作时动态增长的列表的计算成本。

In this case, it would help to set the initial list size to be larger rather than dynamically growing, which can be costly due to having to create and copy over values into increasingly bigger lists. 
在这种情况下，将初始列表大小设置为更大而不是动态增长会有所帮助，动态增长的成本可能会很高，因为必须创建值并将其复制到越来越大的列表中。

### linked list

A linked list works differently. 

A linked list contains two pieces of information, the data and a pointer to the next list item. 

A linked list begins with an empty list and can grow dynamically by introducing new cells to the list. 

To grow a linked list, you simply have to add a new node and point the list at its location. 

This makes them very fast for storing large amounts of data. 

The flexibility of linked lists is achieved by including some additional storage requirements. 
链表的灵活性是通过包含一些额外的存储要求来实现的。

Notably, in each node, there must be some reference to the nodes around it. 

There is also a head and a tail. 

The head is a unique node that indicates that it is the start of the list, and the tail indicates where the list ends. 
头是一个唯一的节点，指示它是列表的开始，尾部指示列表的结束位置。

This approach to growing the size of the data structure is very powerful and can lead to very large but manageable datasets. 
这种增加数据结构大小的方法非常强大，可以产生非常大但易于管理的数据集。

## sets

What does sets entail? Set is very similar to a list. 
集合意味着什么？ 集合与列表非常相似。

However, a set will store its elements in an unordered way. 

Though there are some possible implementations of ordered sets, sets have some unusual tendencies. 
尽管有序集合有一些可能的实现，但集合有一些不寻常的倾向。

A set will only hold unique elements, so adding an element that already exist to a set will make no difference to the data stored there. 

The unordered process in which sets store their information means that printing out a set will not necessarily reflect the order in which the element was added to the set. 
集合存储其信息的无序过程意味着打印出集合不一定反映元素添加到集合中的顺序。

Once a value has been added to a set, it cannot change. 

Instead, you would have to delete it and add a new value instead. 

Sets are exceptionally fast to search. 
This is because if it's internal mechanisms. 
集合的搜索速度非常快。
这是因为如果它是内部机制。

A set uses hash tables to determine where to store the elements of a set. 

Therefore, each number that is passed to a set will have a hashing function applied to it. 

A hashing function can be defined as an algorithm that takes in some data and maps it to a fixed size value. 

The value is theoretically unique and every time the function is applied to the data, the same value is returned. 

哈希函数可以定义为一种算法，它接受一些数据并将其映射到固定大小的值。
该值理论上是唯一的，每次将函数应用于数据时，都会返回相同的值。

This means that searching a set can be done in O1 time. 

This is due to the mechanism that is used to save values in a set. 

You will learn about hashing functions in more detail later in the course. 

A O1 approach would be to iterate over the entire data structure to check for the presence or absence of a value. 

Sets instead apply the mapping function to the input data and check the resulting output to see if a value exists there. 
相反，集将映射函数应用于输入数据并检查结果输出以查看其中是否存在值。

If it does, then the value is returned. 

If it doesn't exist in the set, then the data was not stored in the set, and hence will return a false. 

While sets can perform an exceptionally quick search, performance degrades when dealing with very large datasets. 

This is due to the nature of the hashing function. 

The more values retained, the more risk there is a clashing. 

Clashing is when the hashing functions return the same unique mapping for two different values. 

The larger the dataset used, the more likely clashing is prone to happen, so there we are. 

In this video, you have explored two very important and useful data structures, lists and sets, and learned about the strengths and weaknesses inherent in both. 

You should now have a greater sense of when to use each, depending on the storage needs of the solution.
