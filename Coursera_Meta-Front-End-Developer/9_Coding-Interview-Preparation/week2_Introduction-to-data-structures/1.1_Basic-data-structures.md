# 1.1_Basic data structures

Having a knowledge of data structures is useful for any coding interview may encounter,
from 
- basic data structures like strings, Booleans or arrays 
- to more advanced data structures like 
  - collections, 
  - graphs, 
  - and heaps.

Understanding the data you're working with, and the most appropriate structure to use can be very beneficial.
了解您正在使用的数据以及最合适的结构会非常有益。

In this video, you will be introduced to data structures and the two main types, 
- mutable 
- and immutable.
- 可变的和不可变的。

You will also learn what to look for when considering a given data structure in your own applications.

A data structure models an object so that it can be stored and organized easily in computer memory.

## immutable or mutable

It can be a simple immutable structure that does not change after creation, or it can be immutable structure that facilitates operations to be performed on the contents.
它可以是创建后不会改变的简单的不可变结构，或者可以是便于对内容执行操作的不可变结构。

Operations might include updates and queries to be performed on the contents of the structure.
操作可能包括对结构内容执行的更新和查询。

On the surface, it may seem that immutable structure should always be used.
从表面上看，似乎应该始终使用不可变结构。

However, mutable structures require time and effort to model, and some objects are very complex and not easily modeled.
然而，可变结构需要时间和精力来建模，并且一些对象非常复杂并且不容易建模。

Other concerns, such as space may be a factor.
其他问题，例如空间可能是一个因素。

## data structures
Understanding the underlying mechanics of data structures can be a great advantage because decisions to use a particular data structure can have far reaching implications on a project's progress.
了解数据结构的底层机制可能是一个很大的优势，因为使用特定数据结构的决策可能会对项目的进度产生深远的影响。

While the implementation and capabilities of a data structure can range between various programming languages, the overarching architecture generally follows similar patterns.
虽然数据结构的实现和功能可以在各种编程语言之间变化，但总体架构通常遵循相似的模式。

Here is a universal classification of data structures that categorizes the different types of structure into two main branches, linear and nonlinear.
这是数据结构的通用分类，它将不同类型的结构分为两个主要分支：线性和非线性。

Data structure
- Linear data structure
  - Static data structure
    - Array
  - Dynamic data structure
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - Linked list
- Non-linear data structure
  - Tree
  - Graph


This relates to how the elements are stored within the data structure.
这与元素在数据结构中的存储方式有关。

A linear structure relates to how the information is stored.
线性结构与信息的存储方式有关。

The elements of the structure are arranged one after another, or sequentially, reflecting the order that they were inputted.
该结构的元素被一个接一个或顺序地排列，反映了它们的输入顺序。
Examples of linear structures are arrays, queues, stacks and lists, and it infers that each element is attached to the element that precedes it.
线性结构的示例有数组、队列、堆栈和列表，它推断每个元素都附加到其前面的元素。

Some languages will demand that only similar types of data are stored on the same structure.

Therefore, you will have integer lists, or string arrays.

Other languages will allow for mixed arrays.

This would mean that storing an integer and string in the same array is not prohibited.

This easy approach can come at the cost of error handling down the line.

For example, imagine you have created an array and want to find the sum of your values only to discover that the total is three pineapples and one apple.

某些语言要求仅将相似类型的数据存储在同一结构上。
因此，您将拥有整数列表或字符串数组。
其他语言将允许混合数组。
这意味着不禁止将整数和字符串存储在同一数组中。
这种简单的方法可能会以错误处理为代价。
例如，假设您创建了一个数组，想要查找值的总和，却发现总数是三个菠萝和一个苹果。
Once a simple structure has been created, such as a list or array, it will contain an index.

An index is a way of accessing elements that may not necessarily be the first or last instances.
索引是一种访问元素的方式，这些元素不一定是第一个或最后一个实例。

Generally use of an index is done through a appending square brackets and the location of the item as an integer.
通常，索引的使用是通过附加方括号和整数项的位置来完成的。

So array 4 would indicate that the required element is the fourth item of the array.

However, programming languages are predominantly zero based, which means that the count will start at 0.

Therefore, array 4 would actually be the fifth item in the array.

Accessing an array through the use of an index can throw an error if index location 8 is requested, but there are only seven elements in the array.

A common feature of these structures is that most languages have a built in length method that will inform as to how big an array is.

An example of this would be calling array.length in java or placing it inside a len function in python.

While the mechanism of how to retrieve the length varies, it is possible in most programming languages.
虽然如何检索长度的机制各不相同，但在大多数编程语言中都是可能的。

Arrays and lists are typically first class objects.
数组和列表通常是第一类对象。

This means that all functionality that is available to other variables is available to them.
这意味着其他变量可以使用的所有功能都可以使用。
This definition generally indicates that a data structure can be passed as a parameter to a function returned as a result or assigned to a variable.
该定义通常表示数据结构可以作为参数传递给作为结果返回的函数或分配给变量。

When passing a list or array to a function, care should be taken that the structure is actually passed and not just a reference to the structure.
将列表或数组传递给函数时，应注意实际传递的是结构，而不仅仅是对结构的引用。

This can be a memory saving device used to prevent copying the information.
这可以是用于防止复制信息的内存节省设备。

However, such instances can cause an error if a change in the structure inadvertently affects the array in the calling environment.
但是，如果结构中的更改无意中影响了调用环境中的数组，则此类实例可能会导致错误。

In this example, a string has been added to a list of integers, and because the new list points to the initial list, the initial list is also changed.
在此示例中，一个字符串已添加到整数列表中，并且由于新列表指向初始列表，因此初始列表也发生了更改。

Therefore, it is better to make a copy of the array and pass the copy to the function.
因此，最好复制数组并将其传递给函数。
## memory leak

Another memory related issue to be mindful of is a memory leak.
另一个需要注意的与内存相关的问题是内存泄漏。
Memory as previously mentioned can be arbitrarily allocated.
前面提到的内存可以任意分配。
If this memory is not used, then it is good practice to de allocate the memory location.
如果未使用该内存，则最好取消分配该内存位置。
As a result of careless programming or other issues, it is possible that a program makes repeated calls that result in excessive memory being allocated and not then deallocated.
由于粗心的编程或其他问题，程序可能会重复调用，从而导致分配过多的内存，然后又没有释放。

Over a prolonged time or through repeated calls this can cause the application to run out of memory and crash.
长时间或重复调用可能会导致应用程序内存不足并崩溃。
Most compilers have sophisticated algorithms for detecting and deallocating memory to avoid this issue.
大多数编译器都有复杂的算法来检测和释放内存以避免这个问题。
In contrast to linear structures, there are nonlinear instances such as trees or graphs.
与线性结构相反，存在非线性实例，例如树或图。

These structures do not allow you to traverse the data in one smooth motion.
这些结构不允许您以一种平滑的方式遍历数据。

Instead, you can investigate certain paths.
相反，您可以调查某些路径。
The makeup of these structures means that they can include natural sorting, which makes querying for specific data very quick.
这些结构的组成意味着它们可以包含自然排序，这使得查询特定数据变得非常快。
You will learn about different types of sorting later in the course.
您将在课程后面了解不同类型的排序。
