# Objects

## Introduction

In this reading, objects will be discussed. Objects are the building blocks of all code and play a particularly important role in object-orientated programming (OOP). In this reading, the benefits of using objects will be outlined, as well as some important **terminology** relating to the use of objects. 
在本阅读中，将讨论对象。 对象是所有代码的构建块，在面向对象编程 (OOP) 中发挥着特别重要的作用。 在本文中，将概述使用对象的好处，以及与对象使用相关的一些重要术语。

## Definition

An object is a programming concept that means that a structure has both state and behavior. Here, behavior relates to the object's ability to perform some action. As you progress through this course, you will witness many **instances of objects** exhibiting different behaviors.
Concretely it relates to **calling the methods of an object**.

An example of this might be calling the sort method of an array. This has the result of re-organizing the items of an array so that they are organized in relation to one another. 
对象是一个编程概念，意味着结构具有状态和行为。 这里，行为与对象执行某些操作的能力有关。 当您学习本课程时，您将目睹许多表现出不同行为的对象实例。 具体来说，它涉及调用对象的方法。 一个例子可能是调用数组的排序方法。 这样做的结果是重新组织数组的项目，使它们相互关联地组织起来。

State pertains to the information about an object. Another word for this that you may be familiar with is object **attributes**. If you create a person **class and you instantiate it to an object**, an example of a state might be the person's age or name. The behavior then might relate to an action that is required of this person-object, like run or tackle. 
状态涉及有关对象的信息。 您可能熟悉的另一个词是对象属性。 如果您创建一个人员类并将其实例化为一个对象，则状态的示例可能是人员的年龄或姓名。 然后，该行为可能与该人-对象所需的动作相关，例如奔跑或铲球。

**Classes are commonly described as blueprints for an object.** By extension, an object can be described as an instance of a class. The most common use of objects is in OOP, where code is encapsulated into objects, and these objects then interact with one another. 
类通常被描述为对象的蓝图。 通过扩展，对象可以被描述为类的实例。 对象最常见的用途是在 OOP 中，其中代码被封装到对象中，然后这些对象彼此交互。

## Example 

One of the considerable strengths of using objects to instantiate a class is that you only need to create one template for how an object will act.
使用对象实例化类的一大优点是您只需为对象的行为方式创建一个模板。

Then you are free to create multiple instances of this class that can interact with one another.然后，您可以自由地创建该类的多个可以相互交互的实例。

Consider a football team with 11 players. Only one class needs to be outlined that can hold varying speed, agility and work rate characteristics. This can seriously reduce the amount of code overhead in creating a football game.
考虑一支有 11 名球员的足球队。 只需要概述一个可以容纳不同速度、敏捷性和工作效率特征的类别。 这可以大大减少创建足球游戏时的代码开销。

Characteristics like speed and agility are known as **instance variables** and can be said to relate to the state of the object. No unit outside of the object will share this instance.
速度和敏捷性等特征被称为实例变量，可以说与对象的状态相关。 对象之外的任何单元都不会共享此实例。

Two players can have a fitness instance. Changing this in one will not affect the fitness instance found within the other objects. You can change the instances of a class through the **constructor** or an **internal method** of the object. In Java, a typical instantiation of a class is as follows:
两个玩家可以有一个健身实例。 在一个对象中更改这一点不会影响其他对象中找到的健身实例。 您可以通过对象的构造函数或内部方法更改类的实例。 在Java中，类的典型实例化如下：

Player player1 = new Player(agility = 54, speed = 88, fitness = 90); 

Player player2 = new Player(agility = 90, speed = 64, fitness = 83); 

In this example, the player class creates two objects, player1 and player2. The variables within the class are set differently depending on the values found within the soft brackets. There also needs to be a method to change the variable. Over the course of a match, a player may become tired. A method can be called to reduce the variable instance to reflect this. 

player1.set\_fitness(80) 

This will alter the fitness level of player1 but will not affect the other players. The methods used to change attribute instances are generally called getters and setters. 

Further control of the objects is available through the other methods found with the object. A command such as 

player1.kick() 

would cause the object assigned to player1 to enact the procedure of kicking the ball. 

The player class allows for the creation of a team with varying abilities that can play. Another concept related to the use of objects is **inheritance**. Imagine there is a need to create another human on the pitch, such as a **referee**, that does not play but still performs actions relating to the game, such as running and general appearance. You may want to reuse some of the code found in the player without creating a player. Here you would create a class that holds all common attributes you wish to retain, and each object can inherit them, as shown. 
玩家类别允许创建具有不同能力的可以玩的团队。 与对象使用相关的另一个概念是继承。 想象一下，需要在球场上创造另一个人，例如裁判，他不参加比赛，但仍然执行与比赛相关的动作，例如跑步和一般外观。 您可能想重用播放器中的一些代码而不创建播放器。 在这里，您将创建一个类，其中包含您希望保留的所有公共属性，并且每个对象都可以继承它们，如图所示。

![Graphic depicting human, player and referee hierarchy](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Xfa_xtR_T4uiqcK_wBhC8g_c64532c4a15d456382c65f32539c59e1_MicrosoftTeams-image-7-.png?expiry=1702425600000&hmac=7xq_alyorXwykAcMkxma2qmkYcT8w6Ij5k45ojZPa-E)

Thus, the standard methods such as run, get-tired, and follow the ball may all be found within Humans, but how these relate to the class player and class referee can be differentiated. This notion of having one general concept(human) that can manifest in different forms (players, managers, referees) is known as polymorphism. One shape, many forms. The classic example is the use of shapes. One overarching shape will contain the area, diameter, and height concepts. Then each instance of shape (square, triangle, circle) will apply the actual implementations of how these attributes look in their given state. 
因此，诸如跑步、累了和跟随球之类的标准方法都可以在人类中找到，但是这些方法与类球员和类裁判员的关系是可以区分的。 这种拥有一个可以以不同形式（球员、经理、裁判）体现的一般概念（人类）的概念被称为多态性。一种形状，多种形式。

典型的例子是形状的使用。 一种总体形状将包含面积、直径和高度概念。 然后，每个形状实例（正方形、三角形、圆形）将应用这些属性在给定状态下的实际实现。

## Conclusion

In this reading, the concept of objects was explored, with a particular focus on its usefulness when used in an object-orientated programming approach.
