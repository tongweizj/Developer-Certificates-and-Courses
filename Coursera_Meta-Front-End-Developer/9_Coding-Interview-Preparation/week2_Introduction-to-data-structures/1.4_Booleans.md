# Booleans

When testing your knowledge in this course, you are often presented with two options, multiple choice and true or false. The latter is an example of a Boolean; a thing is or is not. In this reading, you will learn more about Boolean data structures and the critical features for working with them,
- conditional statements
- and logical operators.

## **Conditional statements**
条件表达式

Boolean expressions can take a range of relational operators.

\>  Greater than

\<  Less than

\>=  Greater than or equal to

<=   Less than or equal to

\==  Equal to

!=   Not equal to

These enable you to interrogate some data before running different code options. Therefore, Boolean expressions are often referred to as conditionals. Combine these with conditional statements, and you have an early implementation of AI.

这些使您能够在运行不同的代码选项之前询问一些数据。
因此，布尔表达式通常称为条件表达式。 将这些与条件语句相结合，您就可以尽早实现人工智能。

Conditional statements are: 
- if,
- else,
- else if,
- while
- and so on.

A conditional block can enable you to execute one set of instructions in one condition and another if the conditions are different. Consider the following diagram.

![Flow diagram showing various conditions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LB8FNLanTQmmuFdvXII5VA_111fdb5a41964eef87cf47f99dccc8e1_Reading-image-4.png?expiry=1702425600000&hmac=lUTlrHMGbhLIBuLyGvWnIjeMldy8Kjd0G0SwHfU5vEk)

That same diagram is represented in this Python code:

```python
if right > wrong:
  doTheRightThing()
elif wrong > right:
  doTheWrongThing()
else:
  keepResearching()
```

Using Boolean expressions as indicators, you can then use relational operators to determine which line of code is to be executed. In this example, you have a computer evaluating between right and wrong. This has multiple applications and is commonly used.

Finally, if you have not met any of your conditions, you might employ a catch-all code block. Roombas are a prime example of how this code can be used in everyday life. In place of right and wrong, you will have rudimentary sensors that determine which motors are to be activated based on distance and impact.
使用布尔表达式作为指示符，然后可以使用关系运算符来确定要执行哪行代码。 在此示例中，您有一台计算机来评估正确与错误。 这有多种应用并且很常用。 最后，如果您没有满足任何条件，您可以使用一个包罗万象的代码块。
Roombas 是如何在日常生活中使用此代码的一个典型示例。
您将拥有基本的传感器来代替正确和错误，这些传感器可以根据距离和影响来确定要激活哪些电机。

## **Logical operators**

Additionally, you might want to expand the scope of your application by using logical operators.

Logical operators

|| Logical OR

&& Logical AND

! Logical NOT

These logic expressions can be combined with Boolean expressions to give your code greater diversity. 

```py
if condition\_1 || condition\_2:
  doActionOne()
elif condition\_1 && condition\_2:
  doActionTwo()
elif !condition\_1:
  doActionFour()
else:
  waitForInstruction()
```

In this code, four outcomes are checked. First, take condition\_1 or condition\_2, and let's stick with the Roomba example. If proximity detection or impact detection is true, then action one might be stop and reverse. If there's proximity and impact detection, then it'll trigger an alarm. If there is no proximity detection, it will continue to send power to the forward motors. Finally, if no conditions are met, there should be some fail-safe code ready to activate.
在此代码中，检查了四个结果。 首先，采用条件\_1 或条件\_2，我们继续以 Roomba 为例。
如果接近检测或碰撞检测为真，则动作一可能是停止并反向。
如果检测到接近和碰撞，就会触发警报。
如果没有接近检测，它将继续向前进电机供电。
最后，如果没有满足任何条件，则应该有一些故障安全代码可供激活。

The use of Boolean logic is the backbone of circuit design. It is a way of interpreting Boolean operators together. The shapes in the diagram below are gates triggered when certain Boolean operators are fired. A signal is sent through the wires (depicted by the incoming and outgoing lines). The AND operator says if both wires are true, then continue this line of execution. At the same time, the NAND specifies that only two false assertions will trigger a reaction.

![And, Not, Or and Nand](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/J4QVoMOvT8OhTpy25pf2cw_eb78d21c6fc34f81b3e09aa69d7fb1e1_C9M2L1-image-01.png?expiry=1702425600000&hmac=ri8Vsc3dbBws8oOLQ24_DRNS29vAiZ-Uf7yZyn2DxXI)

Combined, they can be used to make complex decisions and cause a device to operate in diverse ways, depending on the input from the sensors.

## **Conclusion**

To conclude, Boolean expressions are either true or false, and their equivalence in binary would be 0 or 1. Just like with binary, you might think that only having two values results in limited capability. But, they can achieve a surprisingly elevated level of complexity when combined with other mathematical constructs like conditional statements and logical operators. Boolean can be used in your computer programs to inform which operations should run automatedly and form the backbone of circuitry diagrams.

总而言之，布尔表达式要么为真，要么为假，它们在二进制中的等效值是 0 或 1。
就像二进制一样，您可能认为只有两个值会导致功能有限。 但是，当与条件语句和逻辑运算符等其他数学结构结合使用时，它们的复杂性可以达到令人惊讶的高度。 布尔值可用于计算机程序中，以告知哪些操作应自动运行并构成电路图的主干。
