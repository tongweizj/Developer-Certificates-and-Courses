 # 3.1_Video_Project components

Continuing with covering the foundations of your project, the next foundational element you'll be working with is adding components.
继续介绍项目的基础，您将要使用的下一个基础元素是添加组件。

Going through the lesson, you'll start by revising the basics of React.
在学习本课程时，您将首先复习 React 的基础知识。

There are quite a few concepts that this entails.
这涉及到很多概念。

After all, there is an entire course in this specialization, React basics.
毕竟，这个专业有一门完整的课程，即 React 基础知识。

Here's a quick overview of things covered in the React basics course.
以下是 React 基础知识课程中涵盖的内容的快速概述。

The course includes an introduction to React components and where they live as well as how to use and style those components.
该课程包括对 React 组件及其所在位置的介绍，以及如何使用这些组件和设置这些组件的样式。

Data and state and data and events are additional concepts.
数据和状态以及数据和事件是附加概念。

The course also covers the concepts of navigation, updating and assets, and how to use assets in React.
该课程还涵盖了导航、更新和资产的概念，以及如何在 React 中使用资产。

Plus, there is an opportunity to create your first React app.
另外，还有机会创建您的第一个 React 应用程序。

Importantly, the concept of components is at the core of the React approach to web development.
重要的是，组件的概念是 React Web 开发方法的核心。

Of course, React is not the only piece of technology that revolves around components.
当然，React 并不是唯一围绕组件的技术。

You may be wondering why that's the case.
您可能想知道为什么会这样。

Well, simply put, components are currently one of the best approaches to designing, building and talking about web pages.
简而言之，组件是目前设计、构建和讨论网页的最佳方法之一。

Still, React has its own take on how to work with components which has developed over time.
尽管如此，React 对于如何使用随着时间的推移而发展的组件有自己的看法。

In older versions of React, components were class-based.
在旧版本的 React 中，组件是基于类的。

In other words, you needed to use JavaScript classes to build React components.
换句话说，您需要使用 JavaScript 类来构建 React 组件。

One can refer to this time as the pre-Hooks era.
我们可以将这一时期称为前胡克时代。

During the pre-Hooks era, you could use class-based syntax to build components with State, referred to as Stateful components, or components without State, referred to as Stateless components.
在Hooks之前的时代，你可以使用基于类的语法来构建有状态的组件，称为有状态组件，或者没有状态的组件，称为无状态组件。

You could also use function-based components often referred to as functional components.
您还可以使用基于功能的组件（通常称为功能组件）。

However at this stage, there was no way for these function-based components to have State.
然而现阶段，这些基于功能的组件还没有办法拥有状态。

Then Hooks, which are functions that let you hook into React state and lifestyle features using function components were introduced to React.
然后，React 中引入了 Hooks，这些函数可让您使用函数组件挂钩 React 状态和生活方式功能。

This opened the door to a new modern approach to building components in React.
这为在 React 中构建组件的新现代方法打开了大门。

In this modern approach, you build React components as functions.
在这种现代方法中，您将 React 组件构建为函数。

Although the core React team hasn't made class-based components obsolete, meaning you can still code your apps using class-based syntax, there's been a trend of moving away from using class-based syntax due to its downsides and embracing functional components instead.
尽管核心 React 团队并未淘汰基于类的组件，这意味着您仍然可以使用基于类的语法来编写应用程序，但由于其缺点，出现了一种不再使用基于类的语法而转而采用函数式组件的趋势。 。

In fact, this trend has been so strong that very often you'll hear people just mention components when discussing modern React without using the class versus function distinction.
事实上，这种趋势非常强烈，以至于你经常会听到人们在讨论现代 React 时只提到组件，而不使用类与函数的区别。

So in a way, with modern React, it is sort of implied that the only way to write components is to use function-based syntax.
因此，在某种程度上，对于现代 React，这有点暗示编写组件的唯一方法是使用基于函数的语法。

When coding these functional components, it's important to note that you can choose to code a React component either as an ES5 function declaration, or as an ES6 const variable which gets assigned an arrow function.
在对这些功能组件进行编码时，需要注意的是，您可以选择将 React 组件编码为 ES5 函数声明，或分配为箭头函数的 ES6 const 变量。

The latter approach is more modern but the former approach works too.
后一种方法更现代，但前一种方法也有效。

Going back to the React basics course, besides understanding components and how to work with them in React, you also learned about data, state and events.
回到 React 基础课程，除了了解组件以及如何在 React 中使用它们之外，您还了解了数据、状态和事件。

Metaphorically speaking, components are ,so to say, vehicles used to pass around data and state.
打个比方来说，组件就是用来传递数据和状态的载体。

And events are there to influence how these components are rendered in the browser.
事件会影响这些组件在浏览器中的呈现方式。

And it's worth mentioning that although components set up might include things like state and events, the focus for this lesson is components.
值得一提的是，虽然组件设置可能包括状态和事件之类的内容，但本课的重点是组件。

So, while there are many things that you need to understand and to be able to work with in order to complete this lesson, the aim is for you to revisit the basics of components in React, and set up Little Lemons reserve-a-table apps components.
因此，虽然为了完成本课程，您需要理解并能够使用很多东西，但目的是让您重新审视 React 中组件的基础知识，并设置 Little Lemons 保留表 应用程序组件。

Now, let's get going.
现在，让我们开始吧。
