# 2.1_Video_Styling elements

In this lesson, you'll revisit the topic of styling web pages and web apps in order to apply the little lemon style guide and layout designs created earlier in the course.

To begin with, you'll explore working with CSS in isolation without focusing on react.

After that, you'll work with CSS.

在本课程中，您将重新审视网页和 Web 应用程序样式的主题，以便应用本课程前面创建的小柠檬样式指南和布局设计。

首先，您将单独探索如何使用 CSS，而不关注 React。
之后，您将使用 CSS。

From the perspective of react, you may recall that CSS has been around since the late 1990s.

This means that there have been various ways of laying out websites.

Let's explore them briefly.
从 React 的角度来看，您可能还记得 CSS 自 20 世纪 90 年代末以来就已存在。
这意味着网站布局的方式多种多样。
让我们简单地探讨一下它们。

## table-based layouts

It all started off with table-based layouts, which are now an outdated way to build layouts.

After that in the early two thousand's, another technique became popular floats.

As a CSS property, a float is intended to remove HTML element from the normal document flow.

In other words, when you float an element, it no longer obeys the normal document flow.

这一切都是从基于表格的布局开始的，现在这种布局已经过时了。
此后，在2000年代初期，另一种技术成为流行的花车。
作为 CSS 属性，浮动旨在从正常文档流中删除 HTML 元素。
换句话说，当您浮动一个元素时，它不再遵循正常的文档流。

Floats were popular for quite some time, however, because they were not intended for building web layouts, proper layout syntax was still needed in CSS.

With the consensus that something better was needed in the early 2010s, there were a few attempts at introducing the CSS flexible layout module specification or flex box layout.

Which is a one dimensional layout technique used to arrange items in rows or columns.

If you'd like to read up more on flex box layouts, you can consult the additional resources for this lesson.

浮动元素流行了相当长一段时间，但是，因为它们不是为了构建 Web 布局而设计的，所以 CSS 中仍然需要正确的布局语法。
2010 年代初期，人们一致认为需要更好的东西，因此进行了一些引入 CSS 灵活布局模块规范或弹性框布局的尝试。
这是一种一维布局技术，用于按行或列排列项目。
如果您想了解有关弹性框布局的更多信息，可以查阅本课程的其他资源。

However, it's worth noting this initial attempt at the flex box layout in the CSS specification was not entirely successful due to constantly shifting specifications and inconsistent and spotty support across browsers.

Finally, in the second half of the 2010s decade, flex box saw a new specification and wide adoption with the CSS grid specification following soon after it.

The CSS grid layout technique really took off somewhere around 2018 with the CSS grid layout module being the part of the CSS spec whose purpose is to build web layouts.

然而，值得注意的是，由于不断变化的规范以及跨浏览器的不一致和不稳定的支持，CSS 规范中的弹性框布局的初步尝试并未完全成功。
最后，在 2010 年代后半叶，Flex Box 出现了新的规范并得到广泛采用，CSS 网格规范紧随其后。
CSS 网格布局技术在 2018 年左右真正起飞，CSS 网格布局模块是 CSS 规范的一部分，其目的是构建 Web 布局。
原因很简单，浏览器花了一段时间才跟上 CSS 网格规范，而那些不支持 CSS 网格的旧浏览器则失去了大部分市场份额。

The reason is simple, it took a while for the browsers to catch up with the CSS grid spec and for the older browsers that were not built to support CSS grid to lose most of their market share.

So after modern browsers caught up with the CSS grid and older browsers that didn't support it became obsolete, CSS grid was widely adopted.

There are various benefits to using both CSS flex box and CSS grid.

And in this lesson, you'll revisit the pros and cons of using each.

因此，在现代浏览器赶上 CSS 网格并且不支持它的旧浏览器变得过时之后，CSS 网格被广泛采用。
同时使用 CSS 弹性框和 CSS 网格有很多好处。
在本课程中，您将重新审视使用每种方法的优缺点。
你不应该低估CSS flex box的作用和地位。

You should not underestimate the role and place of CSS flex box.

And it's important to keep in mind that CSS grid is not a replacement for CSS flex box, it's good if you know either of them, but it's best if you know both.

Another reason to be aware of the various layout techniques out there is to be able to make informed decisions about layout choices.

In their day to day work, developers are very often faced with having to decide whether a piece of code is good enough or if it needs changing.

重要的是要记住，CSS 网格并不是 CSS 弹性框的替代品，如果您了解其中任何一个就很好，但如果您了解两者则更好。
了解各种布局技术的另一个原因是能够就布局选择做出明智的决定。
在日常工作中，开发人员经常面临必须决定一段代码是否足够好或者是否需要更改的情况。
很多决策过程都依赖于经验。
对于一个全面发展的前端开发人员来说，仍然对现代 CSS 布局技术以及它们应该在哪里使用有一个总体的了解是很重要的。
A lot of that decision making process comes with experience.

Still having a general idea about modern CSS layout techniques and where they should be used is important for a well rounded front end developer.

Indeed, the more knowledge you have on this topic, the better you'll be at choosing the right approach and determining whether the existing code in any project you work on is up to modern standards.

Furthermore, you'll be able to determine the best tool for the job.

All that being said, the focus of this lesson will mainly be on building CSS layouts using CSS grid as it's the most comprehensive and versatile tool in the modern CSS layout toolbox.

Time to get started.

事实上，您对该主题的了解越多，您就越能选择正确的方法并确定您所从事的任何项目中的现有代码是否符合现代标准。
此外，您将能够确定最适合这项工作的工具。
话虽如此，本课的重点将主要是使用 CSS 网格构建 CSS 布局，因为它是现代 CSS 布局工具箱中最全面、最通用的工具。
是时候开始了。
