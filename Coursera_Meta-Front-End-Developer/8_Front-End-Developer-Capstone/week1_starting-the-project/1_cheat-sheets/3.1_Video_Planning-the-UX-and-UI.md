## stages make up the UX process
Did you know that several stages make up the UX UI process? 
These include the 

1. planning, 
2. design, 
3. development 
4. and launch phases

### 1. planning

可以说，这个 UX UI 流程中最关键的阶段是规划阶段，其中包括
- 收集用户的目标
- 以及确定和映射项目的总体目的

### 2. design
The design phase is where designers turn the facts and information from the planning stage into reality
设计阶段是设计师将规划阶段的事实和信息转化为现实的阶段

This stage must produce design structures and sketches for approval and testing

This phase essentially involves the implementation of the results acquired during the previous step
该阶段主要涉及上一步获得的结果的实施

### 4.Lanch
In your case, producing a functional website or mobile application, the product is delivered during the launch phase
在您的情况下，制作功能性网站或移动应用程序，产品在启动阶段交付

There isn't a specific design process for UI, but it's still crucial
UI没有具体的设计流程，但仍然至关重要
When it's done correctly, consumers usually don't even notice it
如果做得正确，消费者通常甚至不会注意到它
But if it's not, they will have a negative experience and most will leave the site and not come back
但如果不是，他们将会有负面的体验，大多数人会离开网站并且不会再回来
To clarify the purpose of UI and UX, an example of a fantastic UI and bad UX is something that looks lovely, but it's challenging to use
为了阐明 UI 和 UX 的目的，一个很棒的 UI 和糟糕的 UX 的例子是看起来很可爱，但使用起来很困难
While something that is incredibly usable but unpleasant to look at is an example of a great UX and poor UI
