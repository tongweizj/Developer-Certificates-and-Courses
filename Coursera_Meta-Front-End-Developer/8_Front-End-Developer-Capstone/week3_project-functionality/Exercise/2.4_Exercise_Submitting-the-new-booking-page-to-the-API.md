在准备本练习时，您可能会发现重新访问以下课程项目会有所帮助：

-   [Creating a form component in React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/item/VpQWd)

-   [Working with React hooks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react/lecture/7Fb8U/working-with-react-hooks)

-   [Data Flow in React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/item/1kwFf)


## Instructions

### Step 1: Set up a booking confirmation page

-   Create a component named ConfirmedBooking that will represent the booking confirmation page.

-   Add JSX to display a message that the booking has been confirmed.

-   Add a route that will allow navigation to the booking confirmation page.


### Step 2: Set up the function for submitting the form

-   In the Main component, set up a function named submitForm that accepts the form data as a parameter and will submit it to the submitAPI (formData) API set up in the previous exercise.

-   If the submitAPI(formData) API call returns true, navigate to the booking confirmed page.


**Tip:** 
You can use the [useNavigate() hook](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.5.0/hooks/use-navigate) to navigate via code.

### Step 2: Update the submit event handler

-   Pass the submitForm function to the BookingForm component via props.

-   Update the button submit event handler to call the submitForm function, passing the form data as a parameter.


### Step 3: Test the app

Run the app and verify that the booking confirmation page is displayed when you submit the form. 

## Conclusion

In this exercise, you connected the form submission to the API. Little Lemon customers can now successfully reserve a table. However, this is not the end of developing the web app. As a developer, you must make sure that the web app is well-tested and meets the user experience requirements. You will work on this in the next exercises.
