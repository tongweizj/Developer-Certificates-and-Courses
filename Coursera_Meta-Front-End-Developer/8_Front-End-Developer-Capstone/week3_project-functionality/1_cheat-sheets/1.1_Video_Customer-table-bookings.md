# 1.1_Video_Customer table bookings


In this lesson, you'll work on the reserve a table functionality for the Little Lemon Website.

In order to do this properly, you'll need to revisit three major React concepts.

- Working with state in React, 
- working with forms, 
- and writing unit tests.

在本课程中，您将使用 Little Lemon 网站的预订餐桌功能。
为了正确地做到这一点，您需要重新审视三个主要的 React 概念。
在 React 中使用状态、使用表单以及编写单元测试。

Being able to work with state is one of the foundations of React.

Imagine for a moment that there was no state in React.

By very definition without state, all you would end up with is a number of static components, and React would simply be a way to divide a large piece of HTML into smaller sections that are easier to reason about.

In other words, you would still end up with components but these components would not allow for any interactivity.

能够处理状态是 React 的基础之一。
想象一下 React 中没有状态。
根据没有状态的定义，你最终得到的只是一些静态组件，而 React 只是一种将大块 HTML 分成更容易推理的更小部分的方法。
换句话说，您最终仍然会得到组件，但这些组件不允许任何交互性。

In this case, the only benefit to components would be how they allow you to split long code depicting an entire web page with smaller chunks.

Other than that there be no real advantage to using them.

This illustrates that in React, components and state are inextricably linked.

One of the simplest examples that is given to beginners when learning about state in React is the example of a counter app or counter component.

在这种情况下，组件的唯一好处是它们如何允许您将描述整个网页的长代码拆分为较小的块。
除此之外，使用它们没有真正的优势。
这说明在 React 中，组件和状态是密不可分的。
在学习 React 中的状态时向初学者提供的最简单的示例之一是计数器应用程序或计数器组件的示例。
A counter would consist of, for example, a paragraph that starts off with a certain number value, under that paragraph would be buttons which when clicked would update the number of values shown in the paragraph.

To be able to code a simple example like this on your own, you need to know about rendering in React.

In addition to being able to use the useState hook and event handling code.

Of course, this is a very basic example but it is often used because it nicely demonstrates different things you need to know of and be able to use in order to deal with state in React.

例如，计数器将由一个以特定数值开头的段落组成，该段落下面是一些按钮，单击这些按钮将更新该段落中显示的值的数量。
为了能够自己编写这样的简单示例，您需要了解 React 中的渲染。
除了能够使用 useState 挂钩和事件处理代码之外。
当然，这是一个非常基本的示例，但它经常被使用，因为它很好地演示了您需要了解并能够使用以处理 React 中的状态的不同内容。

State in React also ties in with forms.

Specifically understanding controlled and uncontrolled components.

With controlled components, you control a given form using React's state.

With uncontrolled components, you control a given form using the underlying DOM.

This of course requires the use of another hook namely the useRef hook.

React 中的状态也与表单相关。
特别了解受控和非受控组件。
通过受控组件，您可以使用 React 的状态来控制给定的表单。
对于不受控制的组件，您可以使用底层 DOM 来控制给定的表单。
这当然需要使用另一个钩子，即 useRef 钩子。

With these two concepts in mind, you'll need to define the new booking page so that Little lemons customers can submit new bookings.

Once you've created an app, how do you know that it works well? How do you know that previous requirements, the quality assurance or QA department, client, or customer have all been met? How do you know that new additions to your apps functionality haven't broken previous functionality? These are all tough challenges to tackle, but thankfully we have testing.

That's why in this lesson you'll also need to write unit tests for your code.

In closing, please be aware that combining the concepts mentioned briefly in this video is not a trivial matter.

Working with all these concepts and techniques takes some time to master.

That's why you should set aside enough time when working on this functionality and if needed, reference other materials in this program too.
考虑到这两个概念，您需要定义新的预订页面，以便 Little Lemons 客户可以提交新的预订。

创建应用程序后，您如何知道它运行良好？ 
您如何知道先前的要求、质量保证或 QA 部门、客户或顾客都已得到满足？ 
您如何知道应用程序功能的新增功能没有破坏以前的功能？ 
这些都是需要应对的艰巨挑战，但值得庆幸的是我们进行了测试。
这就是为什么在本课程中您还需要为代码编写单元测试。
最后，请注意，结合本视频中简要提到的概念并不是一件小事。

掌握所有这些概念和技术需要一些时间。
这就是为什么您在使用此功能时应该留出足够的时间，并且如果需要，还可以参考此程序中的其他材料。

让我们开始。
