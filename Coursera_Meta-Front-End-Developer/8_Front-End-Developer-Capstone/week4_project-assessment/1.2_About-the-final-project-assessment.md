# About the final project assessment

## **The purpose of the assessment**

The primary purpose of the assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course.  The assessment is designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. Most importantly, the assessment helps you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before completing the course.

## **What to expect from the peer review** 

You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course to write code to create a form that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant. Your table bookings form will all be assessed in the peer review submission, and you will assess some of your peers' projects too.
您将结合在整个课程中应用的技能和知识来编写代码，创建一个用于处理 Little Lemon 餐厅餐桌预订的表单。 
您的餐桌预订表将在同行评审提交中进行评估，您也将评估一些同行的项目。

## **What to expect from the final graded quiz** 

The quiz only tests the topics you have already covered, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Please review the feedback on your answers and, where necessary, go back and work through the topics that require further attention. 

Good luck!
