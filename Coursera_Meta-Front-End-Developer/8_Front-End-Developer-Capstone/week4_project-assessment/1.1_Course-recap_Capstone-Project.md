Welcome to the fourth and final module of this Capstone Project course.

Let's quickly recap what you've covered in this course so far.
欢迎来到本 Capstone 项目课程的第四个也是最后一个模块。
让我们快速回顾一下到目前为止您在本课程中所涵盖的内容。

## first module

In the first module, you were introduced to the course and its syllabus, had a chance to meet your peers and learned how to succeed in this course.

You set up your project which included creating your starting react app and tracking your changes with GIT as well as planning the UX and UI of your project.
在第一个模块中，您了解了该课程及其教学大纲，有机会结识您的同行，并了解如何在本课程中取得成功。
您设置了项目，其中包括创建起始 React 应用程序、使用 GIT 跟踪更改以及规划项目的 UX 和 UI。

## module two

This involved working with wire frames and applying design fundamentals in Figma in module two which covered the foundations of your project.

You worked on the semantic structure in your code, ensuring that you use semantic html five tags where possible.

You also worked on meta tags and open graph protocol settings for your app, and revisited the CSS grid to make a responsive layout.

这涉及到在模块二中使用线框并应用 Figma 中的设计基础知识，这涵盖了项目的基础。
您研究了代码中的语义结构，确保尽可能使用语义 html 五个标签。
您还为您的应用程序处理了元标记和开放图形协议设置，并重新访问了 CSS 网格以制作响应式布局。

## The third module

The third module project functionality, involved coding a table reservation system, and defining the bookings page for the Little Lemon web app.

You implemented unit testing and worked with an API.

You further polished the UI in your app, validated the user data, and wrote further tests for your app.

That brings you to the current module project assessment.
第三个模块项目功能涉及编码餐桌预订系统以及定义 Little Lemon Web 应用程序的预订页面。

您实施了单元测试并使用了 API。

您进一步完善了应用程序中的 UI，验证了用户数据，并为您的应用程序编写了进一步的测试。

这将带您进入当前模块项目评估。

Now that you've demonstrated your front end development skills by completing the Little Lemon project, it's time to move on to assessment.

In the first lesson of this module which is aptly titled graded assessment, you need to get involved in the assessment process by doing a project self review.

As well as performing a peer review of another learners solution in terms of usability, accessibility, design, and code.

Not to worry, this is not difficult to do and you'll be guided through it to make it even easier.

This is a fun task that you should enjoy and learn from.

This module is all about collaborating with your peers and examining the completed Little Lemon project, so that you can compare what you've designed encoded with other projects.

This approach gives you the opportunity to further reinforce your learning, improve your knowledge and gain insight right into how other people have approached solving the same challenges and exercises that you were tasked with completing in this course.

After you've completed the peer review you'll have a chance to examine a completed solution, so that you can compare it with both your own and your peers implementation.

This is done on purpose to ensure that you're exposed to yet another approach to solving the exact same problem.

As mentioned earlier, having the chance to examine several ways of completing the same task should add to your learning, give you a greater breadth of understanding of the various solutions and ultimately improve your prowess as a react developer.

You'll finish this lesson with a graded assessment quiz.

The second lesson will take the form of a course wrap up, you'll have the opportunity to reflect on the journey you followed to complete your project.

The knowledge you gained and your achievements along the way as well as potential next steps following the completion of this course.

I'm sure you're as eager as I am to work through the projects you and your peers have created.

So let's jump right in.







现在您已经通过完成 Little Lemon 项目展示了您的前端开发技能，是时候继续进行评估了。

在本模块的第一课（恰当地称为分级评估）中，您需要通过进行项目自我审查来参与评估过程。

以及对另一个学习者解决方案在可用性、可访问性、设计和代码方面进行同行评审。

不用担心，这并不难，我们会引导您完成它，使其变得更加容易。

这是一项有趣的任务，您应该享受并从中学习。

本模块主要是与您的同行合作并检查已完成的 Little Lemon 项目，以便您可以将您设计的编码与其他项目进行比较。

这种方法使您有机会进一步强化您的学习，提高您的知识，并深入了解其他人如何解决您在本课程中负责完成的相同挑战和练习。

完成同行评审后，您将有机会检查已完成的解决方案，以便将其与您自己和同行的实施进行比较。

这样做的目的是为了确保您能够接触到另一种方法来解决完全相同的问题。

如前所述，有机会研究完成同一任务的几种方法应该会增加您的学习，让您对各种解决方案有更广泛的理解，并最终提高您作为 React 开发人员的能力。

您将通过评分评估测验来结束本课程。

第二节课将以课程总结的形式进行，您将有机会反思完成项目的过程。

您在此过程中获得的知识和成就以及完成本课程后可能采取的后续步骤。

我相信您和我一样渴望完成您和您的同事创建的项目。

那么让我们直接开始吧。
