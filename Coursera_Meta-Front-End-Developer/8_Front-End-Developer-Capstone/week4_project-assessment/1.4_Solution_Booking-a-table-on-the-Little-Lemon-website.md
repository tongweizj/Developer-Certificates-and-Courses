# Solution: Booking a table on the Little Lemon website

## **Overview**

Congratulations! You’ve completed your Little Lemon web app along with your peers and are now ready to review the work that’s been done.

The following screens are a possible solution for your projects and the design proposed may vary. However, although the designs may vary, the screens do need to contain the required elements described for each.

Make sure to check that screens you are reviewing contain the required elements as described in each item.

**SCREEN 1: Home screen**

Your solution needs to link the reserve-a-table button to your next screen.

Additionally, the screen should encompass the look and feel of the Little Lemon restaurant brand as per the style guide provided.
