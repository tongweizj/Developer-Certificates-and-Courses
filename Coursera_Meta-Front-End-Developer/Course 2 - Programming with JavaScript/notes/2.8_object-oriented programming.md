## The Benefits of OOP

There are many benefits to using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.

OOP helps developers to ==mimic== 模拟 the relationship between objects in the real world. In a way, it helps you to reason about relationships between things in your software, just like you would in the real world. Thus, OOP is an effective ==approach== 方法 to come up with solutions in the code you write. OOP also:

- Allows you to write modular code,
- Makes your code more flexible and
- Makes your code reusable.
## The Principles of OOP

The four fundamental OOP principles are 
- inheritance, 继承
- encapsulation, 封装
- abstraction  抽象
- and polymorphism. 和多态性

You'll learn about each of these principles in turn. The thing to remember about Objects is that they exist in a hierarchal structure. Meaning that the original base or super class for everything is the Object class, all objects derive from this class. This allows us to utilize the Object.create() method. to create or instansiate objects of our classes.
```js
class Animal { /* ...class code here... */ }
var myDog = Object.create(Animal)
console.log (Animal)
```


A more common method of creating obbjects from classes is to use the new keyword. When using a default or empty constructor method, JavaScript implicitly calls the Object superclass to create the instance.

```js
class Animal { /* ...class code here... */ }
var myDog = new Animal()
console.log (Animal)
```

This concept is explored within the next section on inheritance

### OOP Principles: Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the foundations of object-oriented programming.
In essence, it's a very simple concept. It works like this:
1. There is a base class of a "thing".
2. There is one or more sub-classes of "things" that inherit the properties of the base class (sometimes also referred to as the "super-class")
3. There might be some other sub-sub-classes of "things" that inherit from those classes in point 2.

Note that each sub-class inherits from its super-class. In turn, a sub-class might also be a super-class, if there are classes inheriting from that sub-class.

All of this might sound a bit "computer-sciency", so here's a more practical example:

1. There is a base class of "Animal".
2. There is another class, a sub-class inheriting from "Animal", and the name of this class is "Bird".
3. Next, there is another class, inheriting from "Bird", and this class is "Eagle".

Thus, in the above example, I'm modelling objects from the real world by constructing relationships between Animal, Bird, and Eagle. Each of them are separate classes, meaning, each of them are separate blueprints for specific object instances that can be constructed as needed.

To setup the inheritance relation between classes in JavaScript, I can use the extends keyword, as in class B extends A.

Here's an example of an inheritance hierarchy in JavaScript:
```
class Animal { /* ...class code here... */ }
class Bird extends Animal { /* ...class code here... */ }
class Eagle extends Bird { /* ...class code here... */ }
```


### OOP Principles: Encapsulation 封装

In the simplest terms, encapsulation has to do with making a code implementation "hidden" from other users, in the sense that they don't have to know how my code works in order to "consume" the code.

For example, when I run the following code:
```js
"abc".toUpperCase();
```

I don't really need to worry or even waste time thinking about how the toUpperCase() method works. All I want is to use it, since I know it's available to me. Even if the underlying syntax - that is, the implementation of the toUpperCase() method changes - as long as it doesn't break my code, I don't have to worry about what it does in the background, or even how it does it.

### OOP Principles: Abstraction

Abstraction is all about writing code in a way that will make it more generalized.
抽象就是以一种使其更加通用的方式编写代码。

The concepts of encapsulation and abstraction are often misunderstood because their differences can feel blurry.
封装和抽象的概念经常被误解，因为它们的差异可能让人感觉模糊。

It helps to think of it in the following terms:
- An abstraction is about extracting the _concept_ of what you're trying to do, rather than dealing with a specific manifestation of that concept.
- Encapsulation is about you not having access to, or not being concerned with, how some implementation works internally.
While both the encapsulation and abstraction are important concepts in OOP, it requires more experience with programming in general to really delve into this topic.
从以下几个方面来思考它会有所帮助：
- 抽象是指提取您想要做的事情的概念，而不是处理该概念的具体表现。
- 封装是指您无法访问或不关心某些实现的内部工作方式。
虽然封装和抽象都是 OOP 中的重要概念，但要真正深入研究这个主题，通常需要更多的编程经验。

For now, it's enough to be aware of their existence in OOP.
目前，在 OOP 中了解它们的存在就足够了。
### OOP Principles: Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a word derived from the Greek language meaning "multiple forms". An alternative translation might be: "something that can take on many shapes".
多态性是一个源自希腊语的词，意思是“多种形式”。 另一种翻译可能是：“可以呈现多种形状的东西”。

So, to understand what polymorphism is about, let's consider some real-life objects.
因此，为了理解多态性是什么，让我们考虑一些现实生活中的对象。

- A door has a bell. It could be said that the bell is a property of the door object. This bell can be rung. When would someone ring a bell on the door? Obviously, to get someone to show up at the door.
门上有铃。 可以说，门铃是门对象的属性。 这个铃可以敲响。 什么时候会有人按门铃？ 显然，是为了让某人出现在门口。

- Now consider a bell on a bicycle. A bicycle has a bell. It could be said that the bell is a property of the bicycle object. This bell could also be rung. However, the reason, the intention, and the result of somebody ringing the bell on a bicycle is not the same as ringing the bell on a door.
- 现在考虑自行车上的铃。 自行车有铃。 可以说铃是自行车对象的属性。 这个钟也可以敲响。 然而，骑自行车按铃的原因、意图和结果与按门铃不同。

The above concepts can be coded in JavaScript as follows:
```js
const bicycle = {
  bell: function() {
  return "Ring, ring! Watch out, please!"
  }
}

const door = {
  bell: function() {
  return "Ring, ring! Come here, please!"
  }
}
```

So, I can access the bell() method on the bicycle object, using the following syntax:

```js
bicycle.bell(); // "Get away, please"
```
I can also access the bell() method on the door object, using this syntax:
```js
door.bell(); // "Come here, please"
```

At this point, one can conclude that the exact same name of the method can have the exact opposite intent, based on what object it is used for.

Now, to make this code truly polymorphic, I will add another function declaration:

```js
function ringTheBell(thing) {
    console.log(thing.bell())
}
```

Now I have declared a ringTheBell() function. It accepts a thing parameter - which I expect to be an object, namely, either the bicycle object or the door object.

So now, if I call the ringTheBell() function and pass it the bicycle as its single argument, here's the output:
```js
ringTheBell(bicycle); // Ring, ring! Watch out, please!
```

However, if I invoke the ringTheBell() function and pass it the door object, I'll get the following output:

```js
ringTheBell(door); // "Ring, ring! Come here, please!"
```

You've now seen an example of the exact same function producing different results, **based on the context** in which it is used.

Here's another example,the concatenation operator, used by calling the built-in concat() method.

If I use the concat() method on two strings, it behaves exactly the same as if I used the + operator.
```js
"abc".concat("def"); // 'abcdef'
```

I can also use the concat() method on two arrays. Here's the result:
```js
["abc"].concat(["def"]); // ['abc', 'def']
```

Consider using the + operator on two arrays with one member each:
```js
["abc"] + ["def"]; // ["abcdef"]
```

This means that the concat() method is exhibiting polymorphic behavior since it behaves differently based on the context - in this case, based on what data types I give it.

To reiterate, polymorphism is useful because it allows developers to build objects that can have the exact same functionality, namely, functions with the exact same name, which behave exactly the same. However, at the same time, you can override some parts of the shared functionality or even the complete functionality, in some other parts of the OOP structure.

Here's an example of polymorphism using classes in JavaScript:

```js
class Bird {
  useWings() {
    console.log("Flying!")
  }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
  useWings() {
    super.useWings()
    console.log("Barely flapping!")
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  useWings() {
    console.log("Diving!")
  }
}

var baldEagle = new Eagle();

var kingPenguin = new Penguin();

baldEagle.useWings(); // "Flying! Barely flapping!"

kingPenguin.useWings(); // "Diving!"
```

The Penguin and Eagle sub-classes both inherit from the Bird super-class. The Eagle sub-class inherits the useWings() method from the Bird class, but extends it with an additional console log. The Penguin sub-class doesn't inherit the useWings() class - instead, it has its own implementation, although the Penguin class itself does extend the Bird class.

Do some practice with the above code, try creating some of your own classes. (hint : think about things you know from everyday life)


## constructor function

```js
function Furniture(type, price, deliveryCharge){

this.type = type;

this.price = price;

this.deliveryCharge = deliveryCharge;

this.summarise = function(){

console.log(`This ${type} costs ${price} or ${price + deliveryCharge} including delivery.`)

}

}

  

const furnitureItem1 = new Furniture('chair', 500, 25)

const furnitureItem2 = new Furniture('sofa', 1000, 35)

furnitureItem1.summarise()

furnitureItem2.summarise()
```



在对象中, 要增加修改变量的露出接口



```js

class Animal {

constructor(color = 'yellow', energy = 100) {

this.color = color;

this.energy = energy;

}

isActive() {

if(this.energy > 0) {

this.energy -= 20;

console.log('Energy is decreasing, currently at:', this.energy)

} else if(this.energy == 0){

this.sleep();

}

}

sleep() {

this.energy += 20;

console.log('Energy is increasing, currently at:', this.energy)

}

getColor() {

console.log(this.color)

}

}

  

class Cat extends Animal {

constructor(sound = 'purr', canJumpHigh = true, canClimbTrees = true, color, energy) {

super(color, energy);

this.sound = sound;

this.canClimbTrees = canClimbTrees;

this.canJumpHigh = canJumpHigh;

}

makeSound() {

console.log(this.sound);

}

}

  

class Bird extends Animal {

constructor(sound = 'chirp', canFly = true, color, energy) {

super(color, energy);

this.sound = sound;

this.canFly = canFly;

}

makeSound() {

console.log(this.sound);

}

}

  

class HouseCat extends Cat {

constructor(houseCatSound = "meow", sound,canJumpHigh,canClimbTrees, color,energy) {

super(sound,canJumpHigh,canClimbTrees, color,energy);

this.houseCatSound = houseCatSound;

}

makeSound(option) {

if (option) {

super.makeSound();

}

console.log(this.houseCatSound);

}

}

  

class Tiger extends Cat {

constructor(tigerSound = "Roar!", sound,canJumpHigh,canClimbTrees, color,energy) {

super(sound,canJumpHigh,canClimbTrees, color,energy);

this.tigerSound = tigerSound;

}

makeSound(option) {

if (option) {

super.makeSound();

}

console.log(this.tigerSound);

}

}

  

class Parrot extends Bird {

constructor(canTalk = false, sound,canFly, color,energy) {

super(sound,canFly, color,energy);

this.canTalk = canTalk;

}

makeSound(option) {

if (option) {

super.makeSound();

}

if (this.canTalk) {

console.log("I'm a talking parrot!");

}

}

}

  

var fiji = new Parrot(false); // we're passing `false` to the constructor so that fiji can't talk

var polly = new Parrot(true); // we're passing `true` to the constructor so that polly can talk

  

fiji.makeSound(); // undefined

fiji.makeSound(true); // chirp

  

polly.makeSound(); // I'm a talking parrot!

polly.makeSound(true); // chirp, I'm a talking parrot!

  

polly.color; // yellow

polly.energy; // 100

  

polly.isActive(); // Energy is decreasing, currently at: 80

  

var penguin = new Bird("shriek", false, "black and white", 200); // setting all the custom properties

penguin; // Bird {color: 'black and white', energy: 200, sound: 'shriek', canFly: false }

  

penguin.sound; // 'shriek'

penguin.canFly; // false

penguin.color; // 'black and white'

penguin.energy; // 200

penguin.isActive(); // Energy is decreasing, currently at: 180

  

var leo = new HouseCat();

  

// leo, no purring please:

leo.makeSound(false); // meow

// leo, both purr and meow now:

leo.makeSound(true); // purr, meow

  

var cuddles = new Tiger();

cuddles.makeSound(false); // Roar!

cuddles.makeSound(true); // purr, Roar!
