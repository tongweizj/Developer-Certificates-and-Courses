# What are Keys in React?

One important advantage of using React is its ability to automatically optimize updates in your user interfaces or UIs. 

If React was a plane, it would use autopilot mode in most cases, letting you relax in the driver's seat. 

But even with autopilot, you'll need to take action sometimes like for example, performing a specific maneuver to land the plane. 
但即使使用自动驾驶仪，有时您也需要采取行动，例如执行特定的操作以使飞机着陆。

The same is true for React as there are scenarios where you as the developer, we need to take extra steps to specify how React should behave when your UI changes. 
对于 React 来说也是如此，因为在某些情况下，作为开发人员，我们需要采取额外的步骤来指定 React 在 UI 更改时应如何表现。

In this video, you will explore how to use keys as a way to do so when dealing with lists of elements, you will learn how to use keys to identify and distinguish elements in a list, how to determine the right key for your list items, as well as what using keys incorrectly means for your app's performance. 

Because React is fast by default and designed with out-of-the-box performance in mind, you usually don't have to think about updates in your UIs. 

When computing a change, React applies it's stiffening algorithm to calculate the minimum number of changes that are necessary to perform an update in your tree of components. 

Although this algorithm works perfectly most of the time, as mentioned earlier, there are some cases where React can't make important assumptions to find the most optimal path for an update, which means the developer will need to step in. 

Let's explore one such example. Imagine the drink section in the little lemon online menu where restaurant managers can add new drinks depending on the season. 

When they add a new element at the end of the list, the different algorithm works well, since React will match the two beer trees, match the two wine trees, and then insert the cider tree. 

However, when inserting a new element **at the beginning of the list**, the algorithm offers worse performance because React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the beer and wine sub trees intact. 

This inefficiency can be a problem. To solve this issue, React supports a key attribute. 

What are keys? Keys are identifier's that help React to determine which items have changed or added or are removed. 

They also instruct how to treat a specific element when an update occurs and whether its internal state should be preserved or not. 

To illustrate, adding a key to the last example can make the tree conversion efficient. 

That's because react now knows that the element with the key cider is the new one and the elements with the keys, beer and wine have just moved. 
这是因为 React 现在知道带有键苹果酒的元素是新元素，带有键、啤酒和葡萄酒的元素刚刚移动。

The general rule of thumb with keys is to use a stable identifier that is unique among its siblings. This allows React to reuse as many elements from the list as possible, avoiding unnecessary recreations, especially when their content is exactly the same and the only thing that has changed is their position in the list. 
使用键的一般经验法则是使用在其同级中唯一的稳定标识符。 这使得 React 能够重用列表中尽可能多的元素，避免不必要的重新创建，特别是当它们的内容完全相同并且唯一改变的是它们在列表中的位置时。

The key used most often is a unique ID that comes from your data. 
最常用的密钥是来自您的数据的 unique ID。

Those IDs typically mirror a database ID, which has an ID given to an item in a database that by nature is guaranteed to be unique. But what happens in cases where your data doesn't have any suitable ID or you are rendering a list that is not dependent on any server data? 
这些 ID 通常镜像数据库 ID，数据库 ID 具有赋予数据库中的项目的 ID，该 ID 本质上保证是唯一的。 但是，如果您的数据没有任何合适的 ID 或者您正在呈现不依赖于任何服务器数据的列表，会发生什么情况？

In these scenarios, you may think that generating your own unique IDs is sufficient, whether you do so via an external library or with a randomizer function, like the built-in math.random function. 
在这些场景中，您可能认为生成自己的唯一 ID 就足够了，无论您是通过外部库还是使用随机生成器函数（例如内置的 math.random 函数）来执行此操作。

However, why that approach will indeed avoid any collisions in your keys, meaning that it will not produce two keys that are the same, it will not preserve the internal state of your list items. 
然而，为什么这种方法确实可以避免键中的任何冲突，这意味着它不会产生两个相同的键，它不会保留列表项的内部状态。

This is because when a re-rendering occurs, those keys will be different, resulting in React having to recreate your list from scratch. As a last resort, you may use the item index. 
这是因为当重新渲染发生时，这些键将会不同，导致 React 必须从头开始重新创建列表。 作为最后的手段，您可以使用项目索引。

Since it determines the position of each element in the list, it guarantees the absence of duplicates, but indexes are not recommended for keys if the order of items may change, for example, in cases where your list has sorting capabilities or users can either add or remove items. 
由于它确定列表中每个元素的位置，因此它保证不存在重复项，但如果项目的顺序可能发生变化，例如，在列表具有排序功能或用户可以添加的情况下，不建议对键使用索引 或删除项目。

When used incorrectly, keys can negatively impact performance and may cause unexpected glitches in your UI when updating your list. 
如果使用不当，按键可能会对性能产生负面影响，并可能在更新列表时导致 UI 出现意外故障。

That's why it is very important to make a conscious decision about your key's implementation. 
这就是为什么有意识地决定密钥的实施非常重要。

You have now been introduced to keys in React and how to use them when dealing with lists of items, such as using keys to distinguish between list elements, choosing the right key, and the effects of incorrect usage of keys on app performance. 
现在，您已经了解了 React 中的键以及如何在处理项目列表时使用它们，例如使用键来区分列表元素、选择正确的键以及错误使用键对应用程序性能的影响。


A primary takeaway is to always use a key that is guaranteed to be unique among its siblings. 
主要要点是始终使用保证在其兄弟姐妹中唯一的密钥。

Use unique IDs from your data when possible. You can use indexes as a last resort but don't forget that this approach will not work when the order of your list items is prone to change. 
尽可能使用数据中的唯一 ID。 您可以使用索引作为最后的手段，但请不要忘记，当列表项的顺序容易发生变化时，这种方法将不起作用。

Next up, you'll have the opportunity to explore using keys within list components in practice. Bye for now.
