# 1.2_Video_Using Keys Within List Components

In this video, you will learn how to use keys correctly within list components and react through a practical example. 

Imagine that little lemon restaurant managers would like a separate application that keeps record of the tasks they need to do. 

In order to do that, I have built a very simple todo list app with two different editable todos that are represented via text inputs as well as a button that will reverse the order of the todos. 

I will start by walking you through the code example I created previously with Create React App. 

The todo component is basically a table row which has an id, a text input to type a value and a date of creation. 

Both id and createdAt are passed as props whereas the input value state lives in the dom node. In other words, the text input is an uncontrolled component. 

The main app component encompasses the whole interface displayed on the screen. The todos data model is a piece of state which is essentially an array of objects where each object contains an id and a date of creation.

Then there is the reverse order function which effectively changes the order of the todo's. 

The reverse method from arrays is a mutated operation. That means that it modifies the original array rather than a copy. 

To avoid mutating the react state which is something you should never do, it's important to make a copy of the array first, which I'm doing by using the ES6 spread operator. 

Finally, when it comes to the jsx for the user interface, there is a wrapping div, a button to reverse the order of the todos and a table where each table row is a todo task. Each todo instance receives an id and createdAt as props which we are passing from the data model. Now coming back to the app, the first thing I'm going to do is to open the browser console. A warning in red is displayed. When you're running your application in development mode, React does a great job of providing solutions to potential problems in your applications via contextual warnings as console errors. The warning clearly states that each child in the list should have a unique key prop and that I need to check the render method of the app component. The index position of the todo item fulfills the requirement that the React warning is asking about. So I'm going to use that. Okay, now when I reload the application, the warning disappears.
最后，当谈到用户界面的 jsx 时，有一个包装 div、一个用于反转待办事项顺序的按钮和一个表格，其中每个表格行都是一个待办事项任务。 每个 todo 实例都会接收一个 id 和 createdAt 作为我们从数据模型传递的 props。 现在回到应用程序，我要做的第一件事是打开浏览器控制台。 显示红色警告。 当您在开发模式下运行应用程序时，React 可以通过上下文警告（如控制台错误）很好地为应用程序中的潜在问题提供解决方案。 该警告明确指出列表中的每个子项都应该有一个唯一的 key prop，并且我需要检查应用程序组件的渲染方法。 待办事项的索引位置满足 React 警告所询问的要求。 所以我要用它。 好的，现在当我重新加载应用程序时，警告消失了。

However, I haven't tested the application yet. So let's type some todos and explore what happens when I reverse the order. For the first one, I will type stock take and for the second one, process payroll. Now I would like to reverse the order because the managers should do payroll first. That didn't work now, did it? The text inputs have not moved but everything else has. Well, you have just discovered one of the main problems when using indexes as keys when the order of your list items is prone to change. So what exactly is happening? If I go back to the code and take a look at the jsx for each todo, when I reverse the order of the todos, the id and createdAt prop have changed. But the key is still the same because I'm using the index. Since it's the same, React is instructed to keep the internal state of that node. That's why the input state from the todo is preserved. Now how do you fix that? Coming back to the key requirement, it has to be something unique but that correctly identifies each todo, no matter what its position is in the list. In this case, I can definitely use the id property from the data model as my key. After all, that is guaranteed to be unique per todo. So now I'm going to implement that change and I will run the previous test again by clicking the button one more time. Great, this time it worked as intended. You have learned about choosing keys in your React code. You will come across collections of elements quite frequently. And with your knowledge of keys, allowing your users to do the tasks they want to complete first won't be a problem anymore.
但是，我还没有测试该应用程序。 因此，让我们输入一些待办事项并探索当我颠倒顺序时会发生什么。 

对于第一个，我将输入盘点，对于第二个，我将处理工资单。 

现在我想颠倒顺序，因为经理应该先处理工资。 现在这不起作用了，是吗？ 

文本输入没有移动，但其他所有内容都移动了。 

好吧，您刚刚发现了当列表项的顺序很容易发生变化时使用索引作为键时的主要问题之一。 那么究竟发生了什么？ 

如果我返回代码并查看每个待办事项的 jsx，当我颠倒待办事项的顺序时，id 和createdAt 属性已更改。 但key仍然是相同的，因为我正在使用索引。 

由于它是相同的，React 被指示保留该节点的内部状态。 这就是保留待办事项的输入状态的原因。 现在你如何解决这个问题？ 

回到关键要求，它必须是唯一的，但可以正确识别每个待办事项，无论它在列表中的位置如何。 在这种情况下，我绝对可以使用数据模型中的 id 属性作为我的密钥。 毕竟，每个待办事项都保证是唯一的。 因此，现在我将实施该更改，并通过再次单击该按钮来再次运行之前的测试。 太好了，这次它按预期工作了。 您已经了解了如何在 React 代码中选择键。 您会经常遇到元素集合。 凭借您对按键的了解，允许您的用户执行他们想要首先完成的任务将不再是问题。
