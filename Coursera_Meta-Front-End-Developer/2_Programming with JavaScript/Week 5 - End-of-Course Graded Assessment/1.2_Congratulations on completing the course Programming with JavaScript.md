Congratulations on completing 

the programming with JavaScript course. 

You've worked hard to get here, 

and developed a lot of new skills along the way. 

Let's list some of the key skills you've gained. 

You began with an introduction to programming, 

and you should now be able to explain 

the capabilities and uses of JavaScript, 

describe the background and history of JavaScript, 

explaining the importance of ECMA and ECMAScript, 

and describe JavaScript libraries and their uses. 

You did received an introduction to 

core concepts of JavaScript coding, 

and should now know how to code 

single-line and multi-line comments with 

semicolon syntax and using variables, 

data types, operators, 

numbers, Booleans, and strings. 

You further extended your coding abilities by 

writing statements using conditionals and loops, 

using arrays, objects and functions, 

and enabling error prevention in your code. 

Programming paradigms introduced you to 

functional programming and object oriented programming, 

advanced JavaScript features and 

the operation of JavaScript in a browser. 

Finally, with testing and compatibility, 

you discovered the purpose of testing, 

explored types of testing, 

and studied JavaScript testing 

challenges and testing with Jest. 

Congratulations once again on reaching 

the end of this course on programming in JavaScript. 

You've taken a valuable step on 

your journey toward becoming a developer.
