# common errors

Have you ever made a mistake while programming? 
Well, you're not alone. 
你在编程时犯过错误吗？ 嗯，你并不孤单。

After all, mistakes are a part of programming.
If there are never any errors in your code, that means you're either ==extremely skilled== or not writing enough code. 
毕竟，错误是编程的一部分。 如果您的代码中从来没有任何错误，则意味着您要么非常熟练，要么编写的代码不够多。

While there will always be errors in your code, some can be avoided.
虽然代码中总会存在错误，但有些错误是可以避免的。

This ability to avoid errors is especially true for the mistakes that beginner coders typically make.
这种避免错误的能力对于初学者通常会犯的错误尤其有效。

In the next couple of minutes, you will learn about the common errors that are made in programming and about the good practices you can implement to avoid making these errors. 
在接下来的几分钟内，您将了解编程中常见的错误以及可以实施的良好实践来避免犯这些错误。 

The common errors that developers make can broadly be classified as 
- skill-based, 
- rule-based, 
- and knowledge-based. 
开发人员所犯的常见错误大致可分为基于技能、基于规则和基于知识的错误。

## skill-based errors

Many skill-based errors can be classified as typos. That is to say, they are mistakes made when typing in the code. 
许多基于技能的错误可以归类为拼写错误。 也就是说，它们是在输入代码时出现的错误。

These typos can include

- delimiters `;`
  omitting delimiters at the end of the syntax, 
- quotation marks `" "`
or some quotation marks while defining values 
- brackets`{}`
and forgetting to close brackets.
这些拼写错误可能包括
- 在语法末尾省略分隔符，
- 或者在定义值时省略一些引号
- 并忘记关闭括号。

For example, say there's some code where the programmer didn't enter the closing bracket. When the closing bracket is typed, the code becomes functional again. This can also be extended to syntax errors such as closing the tags in HTML. 
例如，假设有一些代码程序员没有输入右括号。 当键入右括号时，代码将再次发挥作用。 这也可以扩展到语法错误，例如关闭 HTML 中的标签。

Sometimes, it can be as basic as not having a proper doctype declaration in your html code. 
有时，它可能像 html 代码中没有正确的 doctype 声明一样基本。 

All of these are simple mistakes and typos that happen while writing your code, but these are also the ones that take the most time to correct. 
所有这些都是编写代码时发生的简单错误和拼写错误，但这些也是需要花费最多时间纠正的错误。

While a lot of these syntax errors are flagged with the help of modern ide such as visual code, clean code is still the responsibility of the developer.
虽然许多语法错误是在可视化代码等现代思想的帮助下标记出来的，但干净的代码仍然是开发人员的责任。

For example, there are also some things such as using inline tags and writing tags in the upper case, which won't be flagged or stop the code execution but are still considered bad practice. 
例如，还有一些事情，例如使用内联标记和以大写形式编写标记，这些标记不会被标记或停止代码执行，但仍然被认为是不好的做法。

## rule-based errors

Next, let's explore rule-based errors in more detail. 
These are code-based mistakes developers make when they do not follow the rules. 
接下来，让我们更详细地探讨基于规则的错误。 这些是开发人员在不遵守规则时犯下的基于代码的错误。

### Naming mistakes

For instance, did you know that you cannot start a class name with a numeric value? 
Naming mistakes are typical rule-based errors. 
例如，您是否知道不能以数值开头类名？ 命名错误是典型的基于规则的错误。 

While this may not be obvious for someone new to CSS, there are many specific rules set for different elements in CSS that you may come across. 
虽然这对于 CSS 新手来说可能并不明显，但您可能会遇到针对 CSS 中不同元素设置的许多特定规则。

There are also so many properties that can be used for a given CSS selector that it can be confusing, this confusion can lead to errors.还有太多的属性可用于给定的 CSS 选择器，这可能会造成混乱，这种混乱可能会导致错误。
For example, here's a short list of just some of the different properties that can accept color values and be intermixed, color, background, color, font, color and border color. Or there is often more than one way in which the same page can be designed such as flex box, grids, and so, on each with its own set of properties. 
例如，下面是一些可以接受颜色值并混合的不同属性的简短列表：颜色、背景、颜色、字体、颜色和边框颜色。 或者通常有不止一种方式可以设计同一页面，例如弹性框、网格等，每种方式都有自己的一组属性。

All these properties may add to the confusion if not dealt with correctly. There are also knowledge-based errors. These errors happen when you are a more experienced coder but you still have gaps in your knowledge. 
如果处理不当，所有这些属性都可能会增加混乱。 也存在基于知识的错误。 当您是一位经验丰富的编码员但您的知识仍然存在差距时，就会发生这些错误。

There is a tendency to have more and more complicated code using complex queries, such as using attribute selectors or writing rules from multiple classes. 
使用复杂查询的代码越来越复杂，例如使用属性选择器或从多个类编写规则。 

Expanding your coding knowledge will make coding easier but at the same time, it may make things confusing if you make your code too complex. 
扩展您的编码知识将使编码变得更容易，但同时，如果您使代码过于复杂，则可能会使事情变得混乱。

For example, when you have to go back to code after not seeing it for a while and you have to figure out what you were doing when you initially wrote it. 
例如，当您有一段时间没有看到代码后必须返回代码时，您必须弄清楚最初编写代码时您在做什么。 

And that's why you should be aware of best practices in CSS when it comes to error prevention and correction. 
这就是为什么在错误预防和纠正方面您应该了解 CSS 的最佳实践。

#### best practices 

Let's examine the best practices you can follow.
让我们来看看您可以遵循的最佳实践。

One of the best practices you can apply to avoid common errors is using shorthand.
避免常见错误的最佳实践之一是使用速记。 

A code with four properties can be written using one property instead. 
Like in this example, writing it with shorthand makes reading the code easier. 

Learning shorthand takes practice but it can save time and effort if you know how to use it. 
可以使用一个属性来编写具有四个属性的代码。 就像在这个例子中一样，用速记来编写它可以使阅读代码更容易。 学习速记需要练习，但如果您知道如何使用它，可以节省时间和精力。

#### specificity

Another best practice is applying specificity. 
Understanding specificity while writing code can also help you to avoid errors just like you learned in an earlier reading. Let's take this example. Both rules are targeting the same anchor tag of html, and the specificity will be calculated by the browser to determine which rule to apply first. In this case, it will be the first rule that will be applied. Understanding specificity while writing code can help you to avoid misconfigurations. 
另一个最佳实践是应用特异性。 在编写代码时了解特殊性还可以帮助您避免错误，就像您在之前的阅读中学到的那样。 我们以这个例子为例。 两个规则都针对相同的 html 锚标记，并且浏览器将计算特异性以确定首先应用哪个规则。 在这种情况下，这将是应用的第一条规则。 在编写代码时了解特殊性可以帮助您避免错误配置。

Over specificity can lead to increase loading time for browsers because they need to apply specific rules.
过于特殊可能会导致浏览器的加载时间增加，因为它们需要应用特定的规则。

A good practice in programming is to apply the rules as broadly as possible. For example, where possible applied over a container instead of to the content inside it. While the errors and practices mentioned are by no means exhaustive, the best way to learn is by designing more web pages and integrating good practices into your code as you go. 
编程的一个好习惯是尽可能广泛地应用规则。 例如，在可能的情况下应用于容器而不是容器内的内容。 虽然提到的错误和实践绝不是详尽无遗的，但最好的学习方法是设计更多网页并将良好实践集成到您的代码中。

You must take care to avoid over specificity. For instance, where the inside of the layout has a division tag containing a class with an anchor tag to which you may apply rules, this is over specifying the target element of rule. 

Instead, this should be replaced with a class or ID selector. Overspecificity leads to wasting time. You waste the browser's time in applying overspecifics in the present. But it can also lead to you wasting your time troubleshooting later. You should also avoid the redundancy of rules, selectors, and properties to prevent confusion. When using different selectors, you can end up applying rules more than once to target the same element. Another good practice is performing a CSS reset using a universal selector before you begin writing your code. Every browser has different settings that may cause problems with the formatting that you've defined. 

您必须注意避免过于具体。 例如，布局内部有一个分区标记，其中包含一个带有锚标记的类，您可以将规则应用到该类，这超出了指定规则的目标元素的范围。 相反，应将其替换为类或 ID 选择器。 过于具体会导致浪费时间。 现在应用过于具体的内容会浪费浏览器的时间。 但这也可能导致您浪费时间进行后续故障排除。 您还应该避免规则、选择器和属性的冗余，以防止混淆。 当使用不同的选择器时，您最终可能会多次应用规则来定位同一元素。 另一个好的做法是在开始编写代码之前使用通用选择器执行 CSS 重置。 每个浏览器都有不同的设置，这些设置可能会导致您定义的格式出现问题。


By removing browser specific configurations using the universal or star selector, you can avoid the chances of misconfigured layouts appearing on web pages and save a lot of effort later. By continually designing pages, you will develop your skills. And as a result, you will progressively make fewer errors. You learned about the common errors made in HTML and CSS, as well as, good practices to avoid them. Great work.
通过使用通用或星形选择器删除浏览器特定的配置，您可以避免网页上出现配置错误的布局，并在以后节省大量精力。 通过不断设计页面，您将发展您的技能。 结果，你所犯的错误将会逐渐减少。 您了解了 HTML 和 CSS 中常见的错误，以及避免这些错误的良好做法。 做得好。
