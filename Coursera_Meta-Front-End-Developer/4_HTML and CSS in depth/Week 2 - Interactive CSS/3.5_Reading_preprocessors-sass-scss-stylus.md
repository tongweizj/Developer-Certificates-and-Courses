# Preprocessors: sass, scss, Stylus

## Preprocessors: sass, scss

Now that you have learned about different animation effects, let's explore the topic of ==preprocessors== which can make the process of creating them easier. CSS preprocesses are special compilers used to create a CSS file that can be referenced by an HTML document. They are generally used to reduce the amount of CSS you need to write and allow you to re-use values across multiple rules. This will make re-using animations and effects much easier. And because preprocessors are an extension of CSS they'll help not just in animation but any CSS code. Let's learn a little more about them.
现在您已经了解了不同的动画效果，让我们探讨一下预处理器主题，它可以使创建动画效果的过程变得更容易。 CSS 预处理是特殊的编译器，用于创建可由 HTML 文档引用的 CSS 文件。 它们通常用于减少需要编写的 CSS 数量，并允许您跨多个规则重复使用值。 这将使重用动画和效果变得更加容易。 而且由于预处理器是 CSS 的扩展，因此它们不仅可以帮助动画，还可以帮助任何 CSS 代码。 让我们更多地了解它们。

Preprocessors provide audit functionality on top of the CSS features already present. Some of the features of preprocessors include the option to create variables, loops, and if else statements. Different preprocessors each have their own syntax and configurations for adding these features. Some of the most commonly used preprocessors include Sass, LESS, Stylus and PostCSS. The use of these preprocessors requires the installation of a compiler on top of your web server. 
预处理器在已有的 CSS 功能之上提供审核功能。 预处理器的一些功能包括创建变量、循环和 if else 语句的选项。 不同的预处理器都有自己的语法和配置来添加这些功能。==一些最常用的预处理器包括 Sass、LESS、Stylus 和 PostCSS==。 使用这些预处理器需要在 Web 服务器上安装编译器。

In the early days of CSS, the main problem developers faced was the difficulty of managing the code. The way CSS was designed made the code very long, messy and complex. It also made it difficult to troubleshoot. Preprocessors have their own scripting language that adds logical structures, automation properties, reusability and bloating of the code. You’ll now explore some of the different preprocessors available.
在 CSS 早期，开发人员面临的主要问题是代码管理困难。 CSS 的设计方式使得代码变得非常长、混乱和复杂。 这也给故障排除带来了困难。 预处理器有自己的脚本语言，可以添加逻辑结构、自动化属性、可重用性和代码膨胀。 您现在将探索一些可用的不同预处理器。
### SASS and SCSS

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) is a scripting language that CSS compiles and interprets into CSS. SCSS, which stands for Sassy CSS is the syntax for SASS and can be seen as an advanced version of both SASS and CSS. The difference between SASS and SCSS is best explained by the SASS documentation, which states:
Synctically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) 是一种 CSS 编译并解释为 CSS 的脚本语言。 SCSS，全称 Sassy CSS，是 SASS 的语法，可以看作是 SASS 和 CSS 的高级版本。 SASS 文档最好地解释了 SASS 和 SCSS 之间的区别，其中指出：

"There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout this reference, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. This syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.
“Sass 有两种可用的语法。第一种称为 SCSS (Sassy CSS)，在本参考文献中使用，是 CSS 语法的扩展。这意味着每个有效的 CSS 样式表都是具有相同含义的有效 SCSS 文件 . 此语法通过下述 Sass 功能得到增强。使用此语法的文件具有 .scss 扩展名。


The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just “Sass”), provides a more concise way of writing CSS. It uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate the nesting of selectors and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension."
第二种或更旧的语法称为缩进语法（有时简称为“Sass”），提供了一种更简洁的 CSS 编写方式。 它使用缩进而不是方括号来指示选择器的嵌套，使用换行符而不是分号来分隔属性。 使用此语法的文件具有 .sass 扩展名。”

This example highlights these differences.

Regular CSS:

```css
body { 
    font: 100% Arial; 
    color: lightblue; 
}
```

This is the SCSS: 

```scss
$font-stack: Arial; 
$primary-color: lightblue; 

body { 
    font: 100% $font-stack; 
    color: $primary-color; 
} 
```

SASS for the same block:

```scss
$font-stack: Arial 
$primary-color: lightblue 

body 
    font: 100% $font-stack 
    color: $primary-color 
```

The variables have been defined at the top with labels such as ‘$font-stack’ and ‘$primary-color’. This is done with the ‘$’ suffix. The result for both will be the same, and it is not hard to imagine how much time this can save for the developer in complex code blocks where there are a number of occurrences of ‘lightblue’ color. These variables are placed at the top of the SCSS page. 
变量已在顶部定义，带有“$font-stack”和“$primary-color”等标签。 这是通过“$”后缀完成的。 两者的结果将是相同的，不难想象这可以为开发人员在出现多次“浅蓝色”的复杂代码块中节省多少时间。 这些变量放置在 SCSS 页面的顶部。

In the case of SASS, the variation has mainly removed the curly brackets and semi-colons from the code. 
对于 SASS，变化主要是从代码中删除了大括号和分号。

The nesting of selectors and separation of properties here is done by means of indentation. You should note that all this syntax is valid and will produce the same output. 
这里选择器的嵌套和属性的分离是通过缩进的方式完成的。 您应该注意，所有这些语法都是有效的，并且会产生相同的输出。

For someone familiar with programming concepts, these preprocessors also allow the usage of math and other functions that can be utilized for adding rules conditionally. 
对于熟悉编程概念的人来说，这些预处理器还允许使用数学和其他函数，这些函数可用于有条件地添加规则。

Another important functionality in SASS is the use of directives. Let us explore a couple of directives called @mixin and @include.
SASS 中的另一个重要功能是指令的使用。 让我们探索几个名为 @mixin 和 @include 的指令。

__Syntax__

```scss
@mixin name {
    property: value;
    property: value;
    ...
}
```

__Example__

```scss
@mixin some-rules {
    color: lightblue; 
    font-size: 25px; 
    font-weight: bold; 
}

div {
    @include some-rules; 
}
```

There are two directives @mixin and @include, that are used here. 

In the first step, you will add properties that you want to reuse inside @mixin. 

In the second step, you use the second directive @include and add the mixin identifier that you have created using the @mixin directive. 

Similar to these, there are a couple of other directives that are also used. @import allows the import of rules from another file, and @extend allows all the rules from a specific selector to be added inside another selector. 

## Stylus CSS

Now that you know how preprocessors behave let us explore one more of their type, called Stylus. If you continue to use the example above, the code for Stylus will look like this:

```scss
body 
    font 100% Arial 
    color lightblue
```

It is not hard to miss the simplicity of the code without the colons, brackets or semicolons. But you should note that it is still allowed to use all of them in Stylus without any error. Similarly, you can also use ‘$’ or any other symbol before variables, but you are not ‘required’ to do so. 

For someone unfamiliar with programming, functions are a block of self-contained code that consists of steps designed to accomplish and obtain the desired output. The preprocessors, as mentioned, allow the use of functions. Here is an example of this using Stylus.

```scss
add(a, b)
  a + b

div
  margin add(10px, 20px)
```

What is evident in the code above is that first, you have defined a function called ‘add’ and passed the variables ‘a’ and ‘b’ inside it. You added some functionality inside the function. In this case, you add the two values a and b with the ‘+’ or addition operator. Once you’ve done that, instead of assigning a value to the ‘margin’ property, you pass the function add with numeric pixel values passed to it. The output of this code will yield to a form ‘margin 30px’ after compilation. 
从上面的代码中可以明显看出，首先，您定义了一个名为“add”的函数，并在其中传递了变量“a”和“b”。 您在函数内添加了一些功能。 在本例中，您可以使用“+”或加法运算符将两个值 a 和 b 相加。 完成此操作后，您无需向“margin”属性分配值，而是向函数 add 传递数字像素值。 编译后，此代码的输出将生成“margin 30px”形式。

These functions are useful when adding color gradation or creating advanced geometric shapes on your web page. 
在网页上添加颜色渐变或创建高级几何形状时，这些功能非常有用。

There are other features available for preprocessors too. And, just like any programming language, the space of CSS preprocessors is also competitive, and by no means are these the only options available. 
预处理器还有其他可用的功能。 而且，就像任何编程语言一样，CSS 预处理器的空间也具有竞争力，而且这些绝不是唯一可用的选择。

Once you have gained an understanding of regular CSS, the usage of preprocessors should be explored. The use of preprocessors today is almost inescapable given the number of advanced features they provide which are not available in conventional CSS. 
一旦您了解了常规 CSS，就应该探索预处理器的用法。 鉴于预处理器提供了传统 CSS 所不具备的大量高级功能，如今预处理器的使用几乎是不可避免的。
