By now, you should be familiar with creating 

React components and adding text to them. 

But text will only go so far in an app 

and users expect things like images, 

video, or audio for a more complete experience. 

Fortunately, you're here to learn about assets 

and how to use them to liven up your app. 

By the end of this video, 

you'll know what assets are 

and how developers keep them organized in React. 

You'll also learn some of the common ways to 

import asset files to be used in your React apps. 

Let's begin by making sure you fully understand what 

developers mean when they mention the term, assets. 

In React, assets can be things like images, style sheets, 

fonts, media files, or basically any file 

that's needed by your app at runtime. 

In other words, assets are 

all the files that your React app 

needs to have access to in order to work as intended. 

For example, you might code your app to 

display specific images or use certain fonts. 

But if you run your app without these being available, 

it might exhibit unexpected behavior, 

such as displaying a placeholder 

when using a default font. 

That's why it's important to keep assets 

easily and readily available to your components. 

A common way to do this is to add an assets folder 

inside of a source folder 

and keep all your apps assets there. 

Some assets can also be placed inside the public folder. 

For example, in the default React installation, 

you'll find that some images such as favicon 

and Logo 512 are stored there by default. 

The general rule for asset storage is 

that if your app can compile without it, 

you can keep it in the public folder. 

For instance, favicon is in the public folder 

because no component depends on it. 

In other words, React 

doesn't need to use the favicon file to compile 

all the components into an app 

that will get served in your local browser 

while you're building your app. 

However, suppose you have an image that 

needs to be imported into one of the app components, 

then it's best stored in the assets folder. 

Now you're familiar with the concept of assets in React. 

Let's explore how to use assets. 

Suppose you're a developer working on an app 

that helps people adopt animals in their local area. 

You have built most of the apps components, 

but you are waiting on the adoption center to send you 

pictures of the animals that are looking for a new home. 

In preparation for this, 

you create the assets folder in the React application. 

The pictures arrive 

and you place them inside the assets folder 

so they can be added to your components. 

To add an asset file to a component, 

you first need to import it. 

This can be done with an import statement. 

For example, suppose these components 

will display a picture of a cat, 

you type the keyword, import, 

followed by the name you want to give your asset. 

You can call this almost anything you like. 

But it's best to stick to something descriptive 

that describes your assets. 

For example, cat. 

Then you type the keyword, from, 

followed by the path to your assets. 

In this case, it's a file named cat.jpg 

located in the assets folder. 

The next step is to create the function 

and write a return statement. 

Inside the return statement, 

you use the image tag 

and then set the source attribute 

to reference the asset's name, 

which is cat in curly braces. 

Alternatively, instead of the asset name, 

you can reference the path to 

the assets folder relative to the component. 

You can do this with the require keyword 

as well as curly braces that 

encase the JSX Expression and act as delimiters. 

It's important to know that with this method, 

you no longer need the import statement. 

This is because you're using 

the required syntax right inside 

the JSX Expression that's assigned 

to the SRC JSX attribute. 

In this video, you've learned what assets are in React 

and the best practices 

for storing them in your project folders. 

You've also learned some of the most common ways of 

importing and using image assets in your React apps.
