As you have previously learned building a website using responsive design requires 

a responsive grid and responsive breakpoints. 

Bootstrap provides both of these as part of its library. 

The bootstrap grid system helps us to create web page layouts through a series 

of rows and columns that house our content. 

For the grid, bootstrap uses a 12 column grid system that can be fluid or fixed. 

The bootstrap grid system always has a container, rows and columns. 

The container is the root element of your grid.


Bootstraps grid system always starts with the container. 

The container contains pads and aligns your content. 

Its width is determined based on the current responsive breakpoint. 

You can add rows and inside each row you can add columns. 

Let me demonstrate how we put this all together by using 

little lemons website as an example.


All right, I have opened my joe's burger index.html file. 

In this web page I have added two columns to my row. 

Bootstrap is smart and will set the two columns to span six columns spaces. 

If I want to control how many spaces a column uses, I can suffix a number. 

Let's shrink the price column to four spaces and 

expand the menu column to eight spaces. 

To do this, I add the suffix-4 to the coal CSS class above the prices heading. 

I also add the suffix-8 to the coal CSS class above our menu heading. 

But here's the amazing part of bootstrap. 

I can configure my content to use different layouts based on the device 

using the breakpoint specific CSS rules. 

Let's have the content stacked on top of each other on mobile devices and 

have them display side by side on desktop devices. 

Since columns will wrapped in euros, if we exceed the 12 column space, 

we can use this to stack content. 

For mobile devices, I'll set the columns to use 12 spaces each by adding 

12 as a suffix to the coal rule for both columns. 

Then for desktop I'll set them to six columns each by using a cold- LG rule and 

adding the column sizes-6 as a suffix. 

I will save the file by pressing control and s or 

command s on a Mac and open it on my web browser.


Notice that now the columns are side by side. 

Next I opened my web developer tools by pressing the F- 12 key. 

In the top left corner, there is a mobile phone tablet button. 

Clicking on this button enables the device mode. 

This allows me to simulate different devices. 

I select to view my website on a mobile phone device, amazing. 

My content has stacked vertically on mobile. 

Bootstrap has ensured our website will work on a mobile phone thanks to its CSS 

rules and grid system. 

This will save a lot of development time by not needing to develop different 

content layouts per device. 

Bootstraps grid system is very powerful and suitable for most development needs
