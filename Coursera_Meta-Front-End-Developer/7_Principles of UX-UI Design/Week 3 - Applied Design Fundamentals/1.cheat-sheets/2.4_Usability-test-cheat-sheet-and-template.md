Usability test cheat sheet and template
=======================================

Usability testing 
==================

Usability testing is an evaluative user research technique that allows key stakeholders and the project team to understand better how people interact with a product. Usability testing can be done during the design, development, or after the product has been released. During a usability test, participants are required to perform specific tasks with the product and provide feedback.
可用性测试是一种评估性用户研究技术，可以让关键利益相关者和项目团队更好地了解人们如何与产品交互。 
可用性测试可以在设计、开发期间或产品发布后进行。 
在可用性测试期间，**参与者需要使用产品执行特定任务并提供反馈**。

Usability testing research methods can be conducted remotely or in person. The types are as follows:
可用性测试研究方法可以远程或亲自进行。 类型如下：

*   User interviews 
    * 用户访谈
*   Unmoderated usability testing 
    * 无审核的可用性测试


User interviews
---------------

It is critical to ask the right questions during a User Interview. You get what you ask for, as the saying goes! Because the researcher's time during an interview is limited and there is usually so much to cover, asking all possible questions is not an option. So, knowing which questions to ask and which to avoid is just as important as knowing how to ask them.
在用户访谈期间提出正确的问题至关重要。 正如俗话说的那样，你得到你所要求的！ 
由于研究人员在访谈期间的时间有限，而且通常要涵盖的内容太多，因此不可能询问所有可能的问题。 
因此，知道要问哪些问题和避免哪些问题与知道如何问它们同样重要。

### Prior to the User Interview

用户访谈之前

This is the stage when all of the research preparations are made. The following deliverables are produced as part of this phase:
这是所有研究准备工作都完成的阶段。 作为此阶段的一部分，产生了以下可交付成果：

*   Discussion Guide - research questions are prepared here, though what you write may not always be what you ask during interviews. 
* 讨论指南 - 此处准备了研究问题，尽管您所写的内容可能并不总是您在采访中提出的问题。
    
*   Interview Schedule  
* 面试时间表
*   Roles and responsibilities, for example, notetakers, moderators, translators, and so on. 
* 角色和职责，例如记录员、主持人、翻译员等。
*   Scenarios List 
* 场景列表
*   A list of test materials, if any, are required, such as design prototypes, competition websites, and so on. 
* 需要提供测试材料清单（如有），例如设计原型、竞赛网站等。 
*   Reliance on stakeholders 
* 对利益相关者的依赖  
*   Forms of consent and disclosure, etc. 
* 同意和披露的形式等
*   Exit survey, which is mostly closed-ended questions  
* 退出调查，大部分是封闭式问题  
    

### During the User Interview cycle

在用户访谈周期中
Whether the interviews are for exploratory or evaluative research, the ability to ask the right questions is crucial here. Let's explore some examples of how to run an effective interview.
无论访谈是为了探索性研究还是评估性研究，提出正确问题的能力在这里都至关重要。 
让我们探讨一些如何进行有效面试的例子。

#### Different types of questions

不同类型的问题

i) Warm-up question –it is important to get the participant talking and comfortable. For example, you can start by asking, "Do you prefer coffee or tea?"

### After the User Interview

用户访谈后

After you conduct user interviews, it is time to review the data you collected to use it in your design. Debriefing and topline summary are important items in this step.
进行用户访谈后，是时候检查您收集的数据以将其用于您的设计了。 
汇报和顶线总结是此步骤中的重要项目。

#### Debriefing 

汇报
Debriefing aids in determining what went well during the session. What can be improved, prioritized and so on.
汇报有助于确定会议期间哪些方面进展顺利。 哪些方面可以改进、优先考虑等等。

#### Preparation and distribution of topline summary 

This keeps stakeholders up to date on current findings and aids in making initial project and product decisions.

#### Updating the Research Schedule

This step deals with dropouts, changes in participant availability and so on. Stakeholders will always have questions that will be triggered during the interview. As a result, a researcher acting as a moderator should be on the lookout for those questions and try to incorporate them into the interview if time allows. Try to be as broad as possible with open questions. And remember that there is always more than you can say.

Unmoderated Usability Testing Types
-----------------------------------

无节制的可用性测试类型

With regard to its relationship to usability testing, the term "unmoderated" refers to research participants using the product when no one is watching or interacting with them. Unmoderated usability testing can be done in two ways:
关于其与可用性测试的关系，术语“无调节”是指研究参与者在没有人观看或与他们互动的情况下使用该产品。 
无审核的可用性测试可以通过两种方式进行：

### Unmoderated in-person usability testing
无主持的现场可用性测试

The product is used by the participants at a predetermined physical location. No one is watching the participants while they use the product. After the user session is finished, the researcher may record and investigate the interaction and any comments made during the product usage. This method of usability testing is less popular than remote unmoderated usability testing because it requires the presence of researchers and participants at a fixed time and location.
该产品由参与者在预定的物理位置使用。 
当参与者使用该产品时，没有人在监视他们。 
用户会话结束后，研究人员可以记录并调查产品使用过程中的交互和任何评论。 
这种可用性测试方法不如远程不受监管的可用性测试受欢迎，因为它需要研究人员和参与者在固定的时间和地点在场。

### Unmoderated remote usability testing

无主持的远程可用性测试


This method employs a user research platform based on the Internet. The participants and the researcher do not need to be in the same place at the same time to use this method. They could be anywhere in the world where an internet connection is available. The participants complete the tasks, and their interactions with the product are recorded and uploaded to a server. The researchers later on, in their own time, access the screen recordings of the interactions and interpret the feedback from the participants. This feedback may include face recording as well as verbal think-aloud comments.
该方法采用基于互联网的用户研究平台。 参与者和研究人员不需要同时在同一地点即可使用此方法。 他们可能位于世界上任何有互联网连接的地方。 参与者完成任务，他们与产品的交互被记录并上传到服务器。 随后，研究人员在自己的时间里访问互动的屏幕记录并解释参与者的反馈。 这种反馈可能包括面部录音以及口头有声思考评论。



### How to Conduct an Unmoderated Usability Test

To successfully conduct unmoderated remote usability testing, the following preparation is required:

1\. Define the usability testing objectives. 

*   What do stakeholders want to learn? 
    
*   How would the findings benefit the company? 
    
*   Is the research method appropriate for all the objectives? 
    
*   Are all stakeholders in agreement regarding the goal statements? 
    
*   Which of the objectives can be included in future rounds of usability testing? 
    

2\. Determine the participant profile 

*   Number of targeted profiles and personas 
    
*   Age group, gender, nationality, and income of the target audience 
    
*   Relevant behavioral attributes, such as what they do, like, and dislike 
    
*   Sample size: the number of participants in each profile 
    

3\. Screen and shortlist candidates 

*   Prepare a list of screener questions to help you select your candidates. 
    
*   Determine which answers should qualify or disqualify candidates for participation. 
    
*   Level of comfort in thinking aloud 
    
*   Include a question to assess feedback articulation ability. 
    
*   Collect contact information to distribute the usability test and reach out if necessary. 
    
*   Request that participants consent to participate and agree to be recorded. 
    
*   Request consent from participants to store their personal information, if any. 
    
*   Include the type of incentive, the amount, and the payment method. 
    

4\. Choose a platform for user research

Choose a remote usability testing platform based on the information you want to collect and the products that participants will be testing.

*   Is the platform compatible with the research method you will conduct? 
    
*   Is the platform capable of attracting participants? 
    
*   Is the platform capable of testing test material? 
    
*   Does the platform support the devices that the test must be run on, such as a computer or a mobile device? 
    
*   Is the platform video-centric? 
    

5\. Gather test materials 

Determine and decide what you want the participants to test with the following options:

*   Wireframes  
    
*   Design prototypes  
    
*   If necessary, the participants may need to sign a non-disclosure agreement. 
    
*   The availability of test materials as a dependency must be included in the usability testing plan. 
    

 6. Create a list of tasks to be completed as well as a list of usability metrics. 

*   Make a list of the tasks that the participants would be responsible for. Create the tasks based on what users would accomplish with the product. 
    
*   Limit yourself to 5 or 7 tasks at a time. 
    
*   Each task must correspond to the study's objectives. 
    
*   Tasks must be clearly worded and unambiguous. 
    
*   Clearly defined success criteria. 
    
*   Each task must specify an end state so that participants know the task has been completed. 
    
*   The sequence in which tasks are to be presented is referred to as task flow. 
    
*   Determine usability metrics for each task. 
    

7\. Determine usability metrics for each task. 

*   Failure or success 
    
*   Time to complete the task 
    
*   Time to first click or tap 
    
*   Count of clicks and taps 
    
*   Count of swipes 
    
*   Paths of navigation, such as the number of pages or screens 
    
*   A task's number of retries 
    

8\. Plan questions to be asked after the tasks are finished 

Survey questions can be asked at the end of any task and immediately after completion. Survey questions can be of various types:

*   Unanswered questions 
    
*   Single or multiple choice 
    
*   Likert scale of 5 to 7 points 
    
*   Dropdown 
    
*   Matrix or ranking 
    
*   Inquire about recall, task difficulty, and any additional information relevant to providing background information about participants, such as other similar experiences they have had. 
    

  9. Perform a test run prior to the test launch. 

*   Experimenting with the test yourself, also known as a dry run, helps to refine it. 
    
*   Dry run with internal and external participants 
    
*   Determine whether or not there is a fatigue factor in completing the test. 
    
*   Check to see if everything is working as it should. For example, prototypes are loading correctly and are the correct ones. 
    
*   Fine-tune questions and include information that may have been overlooked. 
    
*   If everything is in order, start the test.
