# Creating grids for tablets and mobile

## Tablet and phone grids 

Following on from a previous video where you learned how to create a grid for a desktop in Figma, let's create tablet and phone grids. To start creating a new grid, press F on the keyboard to bring up the frame's menu on the right sidebar. Then open the tablet menu and select an iPad mini.

Select the desktop frame and hover your mouse just to the left of the grid icons. You see a "sandwich" stack icon pop up. You can now press ctrl or shift on your keyboard and click that to select the grid and then copy and paste it into the tablet frame.

This brings the entire grid system into your tablet frame. You may be asking yourself: How would you design a tablet layout with such small columns? So, let's change the 12-column grid to an 8-column. Now, there is a lot more breathing room.

Your grid is ready for you to start your design. Next, let's create our phone grid system by following the same steps. You should start by selecting a phone frame.

Then, copy the grid and change the column to a 4-column grid and change the margin to 20.

![Horizontal and vertical responsive system on iPhone 13.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/xQfRS1HqQXaH0UtR6jF2Xw_b35523a8300b4fc5923e1ebf39a6aba1_iphone-columns.png?expiry=1697673600000&hmac=c-jGhiiyYYggKKXJ8weVsxkl6YCQhK2ty9RdniBivbY)

Now you have created a horizontal and vertical responsive grid system. You can also stretch these frames out, and they will scale accordingly. This is just a starting point. Grids can get more advanced as you get more detailed on specific devices. However, this is good enough to help you start your very first responsive project.  

## Hide the grid 

If you want to view the frame without the grid system, click on the Zoom percentage in the top-right corner of the screen. This will open the View Settings menu, where there is an option to turn grids on or off. Alternatively, you can use the Keyboard Shortcuts to toggle Layout Grids Off. On a Mac, it's Command G, and on Windows, it's Control Shift 4. By repeating the same command, the grid will be displayed.  

## UI consistency 

When your measurements follow the same rules, you automatically get a more consistent UI. To enhance consistency, you can alter the nudge properties to align with the 8-point grid. A nudge is how much you can move layers on a frame using the arrow keys. There are two types of nudges: small and big. The small nudge allows me to move a layer by increments of 1 pixel using the arrow keys on my keyboard. The big nudge is accessed by using the shift and arrow keys. By default, Figma has fixed it at 10 pixels.  Let's change this to 8 points. So, select preferences from the Figma icon on the top left-hand corner and click Nudge Amount to set the large nudge value to 8 points. You are ready to explore creating more grids and working with the nudge property.
