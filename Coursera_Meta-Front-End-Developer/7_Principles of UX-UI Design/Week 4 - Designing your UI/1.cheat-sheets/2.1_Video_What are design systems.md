## design systems

Let's start, in a previous video, you were introduced to design systems.
首先，在之前的视频中，我们向您介绍了设计系统.

You should now know that a design system is everything that goes into creating your product, including typography, colors, icons, layouts, grids, coding standards and naming conventions.
您现在应该知道设计系统是涉及的一切创建您的产品，包括版式、颜色、图标、布局、网格、编码标准和命名约定.

It can also be a guide on the tone of voice for your content.
它还可以作为您内容的语气指南.

A style guide and documentation for developers.
为开发人员提供的风格指南和文档.

A design system combines all of these in a way that enables your team to develop, learn and work together.

Some bigger design systems will have a set of rules and guides that aid the reader through dos and don'ts.
一些较大的设计系统会有一套规则和帮助读者了解注意事项的指南.

Others are simply a set of components and files to inform design layouts.
其他的只是一组组件和文件，用于通知设计布局.

## UI kit
A UI kit is similar to a design system, but as its name suggests,it is limited to the elements and features that populate a user interface or UI.
UI 套件类似于设计系统，但顾名思义，它仅限于填充用户界面或 UI 的元素和功能.

A UI kit still shows a systematic approach to design, for example,a typographic scale or a color system.

UI 套件仍然展示了系统的设计方法，例如， 印刷比例或颜色系统.

It can list a set of buttons, menu items or components but it is not as thorough as a design system.

它可以列出一组按钮、菜单项或组件，但是它不像设计系统那么彻底.

For the scope of this course you will use a UI kit.

## atomic design 

Let's explore atomic design invented by Brad Frost.
让我们探索布拉德·弗罗斯特发明的原子设计.

This is a thought process of assembling design elements to create bigger design
components and it is explained through a scientific metaphor.
这是组装设计元素以创建更大设计的思维过程组成部分，并通过科学隐喻进行解释.

Let's explore this in more detail.
让我们更详细地探讨这一点.

Atoms are individual elements like text boxes, form inputs or links and buttons.
原子是单独的元素，例如文本框、表单输入或链接和按钮.

You can think of these as HTML elements.
您可以将它们视为 HTML 元素.

Next you have molecules which combine atoms together.
接下来就是将原子结合在一起的分子.

Think of an input box with a label.
想象一个带有标签的输入框.

Inside there is a profile icon with a link on the right that says log in.
里面有一个个人资料图标，右侧有一个链接，显示登录.

To the right of that there is a button that says sign up, organisms are up next.
右边有一个按钮，上面写着“注册”，接下来是有机体.

You guessed it, organisms are groups of molecules.
你猜对了，生物体是分子群.

Think of a nav bar.
想想导航栏.

Moving away from the science metaphor, let's explore templates which are like low fidelity or basic wire frames that consist of all your atoms, molecules and organisms together.
远离科学隐喻，让我们探索低保真度或由所有原子、分子和有机体组成的基本线框.

Then you have pages which are more specific refinements of templates.
然后您将获得对模板进行更具体改进的页面.

Think of actual content and images.
考虑实际内容和图像.

This structured and ordered approach to composing layouts is granular for a reason.

It is usually placed on the top of a web page or an app and
display similarly across most applications.
它通常放置在网页或应用程序的顶部，在大多数应用程序中显示类似.

This is almost identical to the log in molecule but with a different icon and label.
这与分子中的登录几乎相同，但具有不同的图标和标签.

As a UX UI designer and developer you can now reference a single source of truth where all of your files are located in one space.
作为 UX UI 设计师和开发人员，您现在可以引用单一来源事实上，您的所有文件都位于一个空间中.

In this lesson you learned more about design systems in UI kits and
在本课程中，您了解了有关 UI 套件中的设计系统的更多信息，以及you were introduced to the atomic design process.


我们向您介绍了原子设计过程.
