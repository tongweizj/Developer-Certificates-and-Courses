暂存与生产

## Development Environments 开发环境

Every development team prior to releasing their new features or changes needs to verify that the code they do release is not going to cause any issues or bugs. In order to achieve this, they normally set up multiple environments for different ways to test and verify. 
A common practice is for teams to have a developer environment, a UAT or QA environment, and a staging environment. 

The main purpose of this flow is to find any potential issues that may arise due to changes or new features being added to the codebase. The more ways to test the changes the less likely bugs will be introduced.  
每个开发团队在发布新功能或更改之前都需要验证他们发布的代码不会导致任何问题或错误。为了实现这一目标，他们通常会为不同的测试和验证方式设置多个环境。

一种常见的做法是团队具有开发人员环境、UAT 或 QA 环境以及过渡环境。
此流的主要目的是查找由于代码库中添加的更改或新功能而可能出现的任何潜在问题。测试更改的方法越多，引入错误的可能性就越小。

## Staging 分期

The staging environment should mimic your production environment. The reason for this is because you want to test the code in an environment that matches what you have in production. This allows teams to spot or find any potential issues prior to them getting to production. The closer the staging environment is to your production, the more accurate your testing is going to be. Staging environments can also be used for testing and verifying new features and allow other teams including QA or stakeholders to see and use those features as a pre-trial. Staging should also cover all areas of the architecture of the application including the database and any other services that may be required. Areas that benefit from staging environments include:  

过渡环境应模拟生产环境。
这样做的原因是您希望在与生产环境中的环境相匹配的环境中测试代码。这使团队能够在投入生产之前发现或发现任何潜在问题。
暂存环境离生产环境越近，测试就越准确。暂存环境还可用于测试和验证新功能，并允许其他团队（包括 QA 或利益干系人）在预审时查看和使用这些功能。暂存还应涵盖应用程序体系结构的所有区域，包括数据库和可能需要的任何其他服务。受益于暂存环境的领域包括：

### New Features 新功能

Developers submitting new features along with feature flags for turning them on and off should always do a testing round in a staging environment. They allow teams to verify that the feature works, it can be turned on and off via configuration flags and also that it does not break or interfere with existing functionality.  
提交新功能以及用于打开和关闭这些功能的功能标志的开发人员应始终在暂存环境中进行测试。它们允许团队验证该功能是否有效，可以通过配置标志打开和关闭该功能，并且不会破坏或干扰现有功能。

### Testing 测试

As the staging environment mimics your production environment, it's also a great place to run tests. QA teams will normally use it to verify new features, configuration changes or software updates/patching. The types of testing covered will be Unit testing, Integration testing and performance testing. All except performance testing can also be carried out in production. Performance can also be completed in production but only at specific times - usually out of hours as it will have a drastic effect on the user experience.  

由于过渡环境模拟生产环境，因此它也是运行测试的好地方。QA 团队通常会使用它来验证新功能、配置更改或软件更新/修补。涵盖的测试类型包括单元测试、集成测试和性能测试。除性能测试外，所有测试也可以在生产中进行。性能也可以在生产中完成，但只能在特定时间完成 - 通常在几小时后完成，因为它会对用户体验产生巨大影响。

Sometimes it is not always feasible to have an exact replication either due to costs or time. Certain areas can be cut back - for example, if your service is load balanced on 10 virtual machines in production, you could still have 4 virtual machines in staging. The underlying architecture is the same but the overall performance may be different.  
有时，由于成本或时间原因，进行精确复制并不总是可行的。可以缩减某些区域 - 例如，如果服务在生产环境中的 10 个虚拟机上进行负载平衡，则在过渡中仍可能有 4 个虚拟机。底层架构相同，但整体性能可能不同。

### Migrations 迁移

Staging is a perfect place to test and verify data migrations. Snapshots can be taken from production and used to test your migration scripts to confirm your changes will not break anything. If in the case it does cause an issue, you simply rollback and try again. Doing something like a migration in production is extremely risky and error-prone.  

暂存是测试和验证数据迁移的理想场所。
快照可以从生产中获取，并用于测试迁移脚本，以确认更改不会破坏任何内容。
如果确实导致问题，您只需回滚并重试即可。在生产环境中执行迁移之类的操作风险极大且容易出错。

### Configuration Changes 配置更改

Configuration can also cause headaches for teams, especially in a large cloud-based architecture. Having a staging environment will allow you to spot any potential issues or bottlenecks.  
配置也会给团队带来麻烦，尤其是在基于云的大型架构中。拥有暂存环境将使您能够发现任何潜在的问题或瓶颈。

## Production 生产

Production is live. It's out there for people to see and/or interact with. Any issues or problems you may have had should have been caught and fixed in the staging environment. The staging area gives the team a safety net to catch these possible issues. Any code that is deployed to production should have been tested and verified before the deployment itself.  
制作是现场直播。它在那里供人们查看和/或互动。您可能遇到的任何问题或问题都应在暂存环境中捕获并修复。暂存区域为团队提供了一个安全网来捕获这些可能的问题。部署到生产环境的任何代码都应在部署本身之前经过测试和验证。

### Downtime 停机时间

Downtime for any service especially customer facing will most likely be revenue impacting. If customers can not access or use your website or app to its full capabilities, it will most likely have a cost involved. Take for example an e-commerce company that allows users to buy goods and services online. If they release a new feature to their shopping cart which actually breaks the payment process, this will have an impact on customers not being able to buy goods online.  
任何服务的停机时间，尤其是面向客户的服务，很可能会影响收入。如果客户无法访问或使用您的网站或应用程序的全部功能，则很可能会产生成本。以一家允许用户在线购买商品和服务的电子商务公司为例。如果他们在购物车中发布了一项新功能，这实际上破坏了付款流程，这将对客户无法在线购买商品产生影响。

### Vulnerabilities 漏洞

Cyber-security should also play a big role in what gets released in production. Any updates to software such as patching or moving to the latest version should be checked and verified. This is also the same rule for not upgrading software when critical updates are released.  
网络安全也应该在生产中发布的内容中发挥重要作用。应检查和验证对软件的任何更新，例如修补或移动到最新版本。这也是发布关键更新时不升级软件的相同规则。

### Reputation 声誉

Downtime or issues in production is damaging for a company as it does not instill confidence in end users. If something is down or broken it can cause the company to lose potential customers.  
生产中的停机时间或问题对公司是有害的，因为它不会向最终用户灌输信心。如果某些东西出现故障或损坏，可能会导致公司失去潜在客户。
