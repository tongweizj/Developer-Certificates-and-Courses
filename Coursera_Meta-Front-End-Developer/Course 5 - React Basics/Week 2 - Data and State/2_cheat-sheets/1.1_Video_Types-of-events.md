By now, you're probably familiar with events in JavaScript. Recall that events are the process by which JavaScript interacts with HTML and can occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. 
到目前为止，您可能已经熟悉 JavaScript 中的事件。 回想一下，事件是 JavaScript 与 HTML 交互的过程，并且可以在用户或浏览器操作页面时发生。

They provide enhanced interactive experiences, such as responding to mouse clicks, movements, or keyboard commands. Because events usually rely on some interaction, they need to wait and listen in the background for that interaction to occur before they can be triggered. Every HTML element contains a set of events that developers can access by using HTML attributes, commonly referred to as event listeners. 
它们提供增强的交互体验，例如响应鼠标单击、移动或键盘命令。 由于事件通常依赖于某些交互，因此它们需要在后台等待并侦听该交互的发生，然后才能触发。 每个 HTML 元素都包含一组事件，开发人员可以使用 HTML 属性（通常称为事件侦听器）访问这些事件。

For example, it's a common feature of a website or app to have a button that when clicked, causes something to happen. This action is an example of an event and is accomplished with either event listener methods or by defining specific JavaScript functions. Developers can use events to execute JavaScript's code in response to an action based on user interactivity, like clicking a button. 
例如，网站或应用程序的一个常见功能是有一个按钮，单击该按钮会导致某些事情发生。 此操作是事件的示例，可以通过事件侦听器方法或通过定义特定的 JavaScript 函数来完成。 开发人员可以使用事件来执行 JavaScript 代码，以响应基于用户交互的操作，例如单击按钮。

This process by which the HTML button communicates to the JavaScript event handler to execute some code and respond to the event action is known as triggering. For example, you might want to listen for a click event on an Add to Cart button. Once you capture such an event, you might want to run some JavaScript code. 
HTML 按钮与 JavaScript 事件处理程序通信以执行某些代码并响应事件操作的过程称为触发。 例如，您可能想要监听“添加到购物车”按钮上的单击事件。 一旦捕获此类事件，您可能需要运行一些 JavaScript 代码。

In this example, I just circled with a number 1 in the shopping cart to indicate one item has been added. If the same event gets triggered or fired again, our event handling code that handles the event by updating the count in the circle next to the shopping cart icon. The circle then displays the number 2 to indicate that there are two items in the cart. Events are a powerful tool and make up part of the Document Object Model. As an aspiring React developer, you'll need to know how to work with events as they are handled a bit differently. 
在此示例中，我只是在购物车中圈出了数字 1，以表示已添加一件商品。 如果再次触发或激发同一事件，我们的事件处理代码将通过更新购物车图标旁边的圆圈中的计数来处理该事件。 然后圆圈会显示数字 2，表示购物车中有两件商品。 事件是一个强大的工具，构成文档对象模型的一部分。 作为一名有抱负的 React 开发人员，您需要知道如何使用事件，因为它们的处理方式有点不同。

By the end of this video, you'll be able to

- identify the broad types of events available in React, 
- and describe some of the most commonly used ones. 

You'll also know how to explain the event handling process in React at a high level. In React code, events are handled using JSX event attributes, which are very similar to HTML event attributes that you may be familiar with. For example, the click handling attributes in HTML is the onclick attribute with all the letters lowercased. The equivalent click handling attributes in React's JSX is the camelCased onClick attribute. Remember that camel case means that the first letter is lowercase and the separation of words is indicated with a capital letter rather than a space. There are many events supported in React, which can be divided into several groups. 
看完本视频，您将能够识别 React 中可用的广泛事件类型，并描述一些最常用的事件。 您还将了解如何从高层次解释 React 中的事件处理过程。 在 React 代码中，事件是使用 JSX 事件属性来处理的，这与您可能熟悉的 HTML 事件属性非常相似。 例如，HTML 中的点击处理属性是 onclick 属性，所有字母都小写。 React 的 JSX 中等效的点击处理属性是驼峰命名的 onClick 属性。 请记住，驼峰式大小写意味着第一个字母小写，单词之间的分隔用大写字母而不是空格表示。 React 支持的事件有很多，可以分为几组。

## events

Those groups include:

- clipboard events, 
- composition Events, 
- keyboard events, 
- and many more. 

Each group usually holds multiple events. 
这些组包括剪贴板事件、合成事件、键盘事件等等。 每个团体通常举办多项活动。

For example, supported mouse events include onClick, onContextMenu, onDoubleClick, and several others. You will also find that the clipboard group has the useful events: onCopy, onCuts, and onPaste. There are far too many events to cover here, but you can find a complete list in the additional reading. The large number of event types that are accessible in React may seem overwhelming at first. 
 例如，支持的鼠标事件包括 onClick、onContextMenu、onDoubleClick 等。 您还会发现剪贴板组具有有用的事件：onCopy、onCuts 和 onPaste。 这里涉及的事件太多，但您可以在附加阅读中找到完整的列表。 React 中可访问的大量事件类型乍一看似乎令人难以承受。

But note that it's actually the browser that comes with these features as the various devices that we use to access the incident have given rise to many ways for users to interact with websites. This means these events are not specific to React and it's probably not necessary to learn about all of these events. Also keep in mind that many of these events are related to specific use cases. 
但请注意，实际上是浏览器附带了这些功能，因为我们用于访问该事件的各种设备已经催生了用户与网站交互的多种方式。 这意味着这些事件并不是 React 特有的，并且可能没有必要了解所有这些事件。 另请记住，其中许多事件都与特定用例相关。

For example, several of the mouse events are limited to the drag and drop API. In other words, at this point in your learning journey, your focus should be on understanding the overall event handling process and what capabilities events can open up to you. In this video, you learned about the types of events available in React and how they came to be. 
例如，一些鼠标事件仅限于拖放 API。 换句话说，在您学习之旅的这一点上，**您的重点应该是了解整个事件处理流程以及事件可以为您提供哪些功能**。 在本视频中，您了解了 React 中可用的事件类型以及它们是如何形成的。

Next, you'll explore specific examples and build the skills to use events competently from various situations.
接下来，您将探索具体示例并培养在各种情况下胜任使用事件的技能。
