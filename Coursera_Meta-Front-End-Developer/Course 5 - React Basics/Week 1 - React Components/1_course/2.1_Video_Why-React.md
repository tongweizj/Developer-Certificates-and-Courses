React is used everywhere in the tech world and you'll have the chance to use it throughout your career. It's a very valuable skill set to have.
React 在科技界随处可见，您将有机会在整个职业生涯中使用它。 这是一项非常有价值的技能。

My name is Katie and I'm a Software Engineer on the React Apps team at Meta, and we work on building new features using React for facebook.com. My first encounter with React was actually in a senior design project back at college. We were looking for a great client-side library to use for an app that we were building. React seemed like the easiest to use and the fastest to build on. 
我叫 Katie，是 Meta React Apps 团队的一名软件工程师，我们致力于使用 React 为 facebook.com 构建新功能。 我第一次接触 React 是在大学的一个高级设计项目中。 我们正在寻找一个出色的客户端库来用于我们正在构建的应用程序。 React 似乎是最容易使用且构建速度最快的。

I had already gotten my job at Meta, but I didn't know what I was going to be working on at Meta. It was cool to get this experience with React, realized I really enjoy working with it and then get to do it in my day-to-day work. I feel like in school you tend to do a lot of object-oriented programming which uses inheritance. React doesn't use any of that. It uses something called composition. 
我已经在 Meta 找到了工作，但我不知道自己要在 Meta 做什么。 获得 React 的体验真是太酷了，我意识到我真的很喜欢使用它，然后在我的日常工作中做到这一点。 我觉得在学校里你倾向于做很多使用继承的面向对象编程。 React 不使用任何这些。 它使用一种称为组合的东西。

That was a little bit difficult to think about, but there's so much documentation around React and such a strong community that it's easy to pick up. You have support coming from so many different places. You can just go onto YouTube and watch a video, read through the documentation, or look at other open source projects that use React. There's so many resources to pull from. I think developers outside of Meta choose to use React for the same reasons that we do at Meta. It's super easy to learn and pick up. 

You're able to create really custom UIs with React, we're building so many different features on facebook.com every day that require a lot of custom components and UIs. 

It's nice to have the flexibility that React provides. 

I would say React is the best choice for an app if your UI is really costume and you're looking for a lot of flexibility with what other libraries you can integrate for your app or website. 

React is just a front-end library. 
这有点难以想象，但是关于 React 的文档非常多，社区也非常强大，所以很容易掌握。 你们得到了来自许多不同地方的支持。 您可以访问 YouTube 并观看视频、阅读文档或查看其他使用 React 的开源项目。 有很多资源可供借鉴。 我认为 Meta 之外的开发人员选择使用 React 的原因与我们在 Meta 的原因相同。 它非常容易学习和掌握。 您可以使用 React 创建真正的自定义 UI，我们每天都在 facebook.com 上构建许多不同的功能，这些功能需要大量自定义组件和 UI。 拥有 React 提供的灵活性真是太好了。 我想说，如果您的 UI 确实很漂亮，并且您正在寻找可以为您的应用程序或网站集成的其他库的灵活性，那么 React 是应用程序的最佳选择。 React 只是一个前端库。

You're going to need to interact with other third-party libraries too, and if you want the flexibility of integrating with redox or other third-party libraries, React is the perfect choice for you. 

React is also great if you have complex UIs where you want to reuse code across many different pages. I think it's a great choice if you're building a complex website with a ton of features across a ton of different pages. 

I think react solves the problem of code reusability really well. Here at Meta, we have a core set of UI components that were actually able to reuse across the site. 

This means that we're able to build a lot of functionality into these core UI components like accessibility. 
您还需要与其他第三方库进行交互，如果您想要与 redox 或其他第三方库集成的灵活性，React 是您的完美选择。 如果您有复杂的 UI，并且想要在许多不同的页面上重用代码，React 也很棒。 我认为如果您正在构建一个复杂的网站，并且在大量不同的页面上具有大量功能，那么这是一个不错的选择。 我认为React很好地解决了代码可重用性的问题。 在 Meta，我们拥有一组核心 UI 组件，实际上可以在整个网站上重复使用。 这意味着我们能够在这些核心 UI 组件中构建许多功能，例如辅助功能。

I think we're able to have like a high-quality bar across the site just because we're reusing components everywhere and we're able to share code even across Facebook and Instagram and Messenger. 

I think that's a really unique part of React. 

It's really interesting because if I find a bug and a core UI component and I fix it, I'm not only fixing it for my one use case, I'm fixing it for use cases across the site. 
我认为我们能够在整个网站上拥有一个高质量的栏，只是因为我们在各处重用组件，并且我们甚至能够在 Facebook、Instagram 和 Messenger 之间共享代码。 我认为这是 React 真正独特的部分。 这真的很有趣，因为如果我发现一个错误和一个核心 UI 组件并修复它，我不仅会针对我的一个用例修复它，还会针对整个站点的用例修复它。

I think it's a really smart way to use engineering effort, you're fixing a bug once and you're solving one problem everywhere. I would say the biggest competitor of React is Angular. 

Angular is a bit different from React in that it's a full-fledged solution for an app or website. 

You don't really need to integrate with third-party libraries when using Angular. Whereas with React, it's just a client-side library. 
我认为这是利用工程工作的一种非常聪明的方式，你修复了一次错误，就解决了所有地方的一个问题。 我想说 React 最大的竞争对手是 Angular。 Angular 与 React 有点不同，因为它是应用程序或网站的成熟解决方案。 使用 Angular 时，您实际上并不需要与第三方库集成。 而 React，它只是一个客户端库。

You do need to figure out how you're going to do routing and server client communication. I would say React provides more flexibility with creating these complex costume UIs. Whereas angular makes it easier to create a single page web application with like an out-of-the-box solution. Learn by doing, try to make an example app. Don't go and try to create the most complex app you've ever heard of. I would say start simple. 
您确实需要弄清楚如何进行路由和服务器客户端通信。 我想说 React 在创建这些复杂的服装 UI 方面提供了更大的灵活性。 而 Angular 可以更轻松地使用开箱即用的解决方案创建单页 Web 应用程序。 边做边学，尝试制作一个示例应用程序。 不要尝试创建您听说过的最复杂的应用程序。 我想说从简单开始。

Make sure you're using best practices. Continuously reference documentation to see if you're using hooks the way you're supposed to and that thing. It should come pretty easily. 

I think one of the great benefits of React is how easy it is to pick up and learn. There are a lot of different pieces of React and a lot of different concepts to learn. But it's really well worth it in the end because you're going to encounter React in your day-to-day work. Hopefully for the rest of your career. There's a huge community behind you ready to help answer questions about React too.
确保您使用最佳实践。 不断地参考文档，看看你是否按照你应该的方式使用钩子以及那个东西。 它应该很容易实现。 我认为 React 的一大好处是它很容易上手和学习。 React 有很多不同的部分和很多不同的概念需要学习。 但最终这确实是值得的，因为你将在日常工作中遇到 React。 希望你余下的职业生涯都能如此。 您身后有一个庞大的社区，随时准备帮助回答有关 React 的问题。
