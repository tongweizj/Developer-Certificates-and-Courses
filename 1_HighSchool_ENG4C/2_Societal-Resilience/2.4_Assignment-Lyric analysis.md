## Instructions

### 1. Choose a song.
 
In Learning Activity 2.3, you explored audio previews and lyrics of available songs in five curated playlists. 

Explore the songs you find interesting in full by finding them online. Pick ONE song to analyze from the curated playlists.

### 2. Analyze your song for meaning
 Lyric Analysis Graphic Organizer 这个表格有两部分
#### Part 1 

For the song you chose, complete Part 1 of the [Lyric Analysis Graphic Organizer](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_02_lyric_analysis_graphic_or.pdf?ou=22862564) 

When you have completed Part 1 of the analysis, think about what you still need to learn in order to understand the meaning of the song you chose. 

How will you proceed to gather this information? You will return to this graphic organizer to fill out Part 2 later. 
您将如何收集这些信息？ 
稍后您将返回到此图形管理器填写第 2 部分。

You will be required to submit the completed L**yric Analysis Graphic Organizer** along with your **audio-visual presentation**.
您将需要提交完整的L**yric Analysis Graphic Organizer** 以及您的**presentation**。


### 3. Research your song.

The biographical context of the songwriter/artist and the historical/social context in which the song was written will affect your interpretation and understanding of the song. 
歌曲作者/艺术家的传记背景以及歌曲创作的历史/社会背景将影响您对歌曲的解释和理解。

To gain some context:
- research the songwriter/artist to learn more about him/her/them; 
- - 研究歌曲作者/艺术家以更多地了解他/她/他们；
- and research what inspired and influenced the song (gather information on a particular social issue or movement, how the lyrics refer to the issue/movement, and the current state of the issue/movement).
研究歌曲的灵感和影响因素
- 收集有关特定社会问题或运动的信息、
- 歌词如何提及该问题/运动
- 以及该问题/运动的当前状态）。


You may find it helpful to revisit some of the social movements you explored in Learning Activity 2.3. Record your research findings in Part 2 of the Lyric Analysis Graphic Organizer from Step 2. 
您可能会发现重新审视您在学习活动 2.3 中探索的一些社会运动很有帮助。
将您的研究结果记录在第 2 步的歌词分析图形组织器的第 2 部分中。

As you research, it's a good idea to keep track of your sources (for images & information) since you will need to include a MLA-formatted Works Cited list as part of your audio-visual presentation.
在您研究时，最好跟踪您的来源（图像和信息），因为您需要将 MLA 格式的被引作品列表作为视听演示的一部分。
Check out the [MLA Citation Guide(Opens in new window)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_01.05.05.html?ou=22862564) to help you cite sources.


### 4. Review your lyric analysis.

Review the graphic organizer you completed in Step 2 and Step 3 to ensure that it includes the following elements:
 要保证，包含下面这些元素   
- biographical context of the songwriter/artist
- overview of the social issues or movements that inspired or influenced the song
- analysis of the lyrics as they connect to the social issues or movements
- discussion of how relevant the lyrics are today
- images related to the lyrics and to the biographical, historical, and social context of the song

- 启发或影响歌曲的社会问题或运动的概述
- 分析歌词与社会问题或运动的联系

Consider whether you need to do additional research. Do you need to reconsider any images you chose? Do you need to fine tune or add to your lyric analysis?
考虑是否需要进行额外的研究。 您需要重新考虑您选择的任何图像吗？ 您需要微调或添加到您的歌词分析中吗？

### 5. Plan your audio-visual presentation 

about the song you analyzed.
Use your lyric analysis to create your audio-visual presentation. 
Your presentation will be a combination of audio and slides.

### 1. Develop a presentation storyboard

Now that you have some ideas on effective presentation structure and design, create a storyboard (print or digital) to outline your presentation.

You will be required to submit your **presentation storyboard** along with your final audio-visual presentation. The following is a basic model of what your storyboard needs to include:

- What are the three main things that you want your audience to know about how the songwriter/artist of your song chose to speak up?

- How are you going to organize your information to convince your audience of the importance and impact of the song you chose?
    
| Audio | Visuals |
| ---- | ---- |
| A script of what you are going to communicate. | Images that you will use at different points, properly cited in MLA style. |
|  |  |
You may choose to create your storyboard on paper. You can find storyboard templates online and print them to help you create your storyboard. For example, the website Printable Paper has many available storyboard templates you can download and print. You can also choose to create your storyboard digitally using digital tools such as Canva, Visme, Google Docs, Google Drawings, Microsoft Word or any other tool you’re familiar with.


### 7. Create your presentation. 
Once you have completed your storyboard, you are ready to transform it into an audio-visual presentation, combining images and audio narration. 
完成故事板后，您就可以将其转换为结合图像和音频旁白的视听演示。

Your presentation must meet the following requirements:

- 3-5 minute audio-visual presentation
- 20 slides maximum
- clear beginning, middle, and end
- images and audio narration that connect to the purpose of the presentation (the importance and impact of your song)
- audio narration that is delivered slowly, clearly, and with emotion
- MLA-formatted Works Cited list (for images & information) is included at end of presentation
- 3-5分钟视听演示
- 最多 20 张幻灯片
- 清晰的开头、中间和结尾
- 与演示目的相关的图像和音频旁白（歌曲的重要性和影响力）
- 缓慢、清晰、充满情感的音频旁白
- MLA 格式的被引作品列表（用于图像和信息）包含在演示文稿的末尾
In order to create your slides for your audio-visual presentation, you may use digital tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Prezi, Keynote or any other slideshow-generating platform you are familiar with. 

In order to create your audio narration for your presentation, you may choose to create a slideshow embedded with audio by recording your audio narration using Audacity or any audio recording app you are comfortable using and adding the audio to your slides. You may also choose to create a screen-record video of your slideshow with audio narration instead, by using WeVideo, Screencast-o-matic, Screencastify, Powtoon, or any other screen-recording software you are familiar with.
   
Check out the following resources on creating audio narration:

You can improve your flow and confidence by practising in front of someone before recording. If possible, find someone to show your presentation to while you practise your audio narration. Ask this person for feedback on the following questions:

- Is my focus clear?
- Does my presentation have clear beginning, middle, and end?
- Do my images connect with what I am saying?
- Is my delivery clear?
- How can I improve my delivery?

Using the feedback you received, record the final version of your audio narration and add it to your presentation.
