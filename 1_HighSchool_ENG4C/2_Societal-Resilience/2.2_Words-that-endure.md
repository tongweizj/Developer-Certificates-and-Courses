### yes we can

**[Former U.S. President Barack Obama]:** 
For when we have faced down impossible odds, we’ve been told we’re not ready, or that we shouldn’t try, or that we can’t. Generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of the people – “Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.” …. 

It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of the nation – “Yes, we can”. It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail toward freedom regardless of race – “Yes, we can”.

It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores, and pioneers as they pushed westward against the unforgiving wilderness – “Yes, we can”. 

It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a King who took us to the mountain top and pointed the way to the promised land – ‘Yes, we can to justice and equality.’

### I have a dream
**[Martin Luther King Jr.]:** 
I still have a dream. I still have a dream; 
a dream deeply routed in the American dream. 
I have a dream that one day, this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down at the table of brotherhood. 

I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice…I have a dream.

### **Not every human being is going to be a human being like you**

**[Adrienne Clarkson]:** 

The depth of your education, your commitment to what you’ve learned will be measured by how you cope in a society 
where everyone is not like you and not everyone is going to be your friend. 

Not everyone is like you and that’s something to remember. 
Not every human being is going to be a human being like you. 
But we’re all human beings and no human being is more human than any other.

### Right
**[Malala Yousafzai]:** 

There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for their rights but struggling to achieve their goals of peace, education and equality. 

Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured, I am just one of them. 

So here I stand, so here I stand, one girl among many. 
I speak, not for myself, but for those without voice who cannot be heard; 
those who have fought for their rights 
– their right to live in peace, 
their right to achieve it with dignity, 
their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated.
