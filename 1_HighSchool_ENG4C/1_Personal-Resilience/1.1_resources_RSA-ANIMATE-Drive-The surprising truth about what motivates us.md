## 字幕

Our motivations are unbelievably interesting. 

I've been working on this for a few years and I find the topic still  amazingly engaging and interesting,  so I want to tell you about that. 
我发现这个话题仍然非常有吸引力和有趣，所以我想告诉你这一点。

The science is really surprising.  It's a little bit freaky! 

We are not as endlessly manipulable  and as predictable  as you would think. 
我们并不像你想象的那样可以无休止地被操纵和可预测

There's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies.

I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something, you get more of the behaviour you want and if you punish something you get less of it. 
我想给你们两个质疑这样一个想法：
1. 如果你奖励某件事，你会得到更多你想要的行为
2.如果你惩罚某事，你得到的就会更少。

Let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts,  in the northeast of the United States,  and talk about a study at MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

They took a whole group of students and gave them a set of challenges.  Things like... ..They gave them these challenges 
and, to incentivise performance,  they gave them three levels of reward. 
If you did pretty well, you got a small monetary reward. 
If you did medium well, you got a medium monetary reward. 
If you were one of the top performers, you got a large cash prize. 

We've seen this movie before. This is a typical motivation scheme 
within organisations. 

We reward the very top performers. We ignore the low performers.  Folks in the middle, OK, you get a little bit. 

So what happens? They do the test. They have these incentives. 
Here's what they found out. 

As long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as they would be expected. The higher the pay, the better the performance. That makes sense. 

But here's what happened. Once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill,  a larger reward led to poorer performance. 
一旦任务需要基本的认知技能，更大的奖励就会导致表现更差。

This is strange. How can that possibly be? 
What's interesting is that these folks who did this are economists,  two at MIT, one at University of Chicago, one at Carnegie Mellon,  the top tier of the economics profession. 

They're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics -  the higher the reward, the better the performance. 
他们得出的结论似乎与我们许多人在经济学中学到的知识相反——奖励越高，
绩效就越好。

They're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill, it's the other way around. The idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely left-wing and socialist, doesn't it? 
他们说，一旦你超越了基本的认知技能，情况就会相反。这些奖励不会以这种方式发挥作用的想法似乎有点左翼和社会主义，不是吗？

It's a weird socialist conspiracy. For those of you who have those conspiracy theories,  I want to point out the notoriously left-wing socialist group  that financed the research -  the Federal Reserve Bank. 
我想指出资助这项研究的臭名昭著的左翼社会主义团体—联邦储备银行。

This is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that seems to defy the laws of behavioural physics. 
这是主流中的主流，得出的结论似乎违背了行为物理学定律。

This is strange, so what do they do? They say, "This is freaky. 

Let's test it somewhere else. "Maybe that $50, $60 prize  "isn't sufficiently motivating  for an MIT student! 
 "Let's go to a place where $50 is more significant, relatively. 
 "We're going to go to Madurai, rural India,  "where $50, $60 is actually  a significant sum of money." 

 They replicated the experiment in India, roughly as follows. 
 Small rewards -  the equivalent of two weeks' salary.
 I mean, sorry, low performance -  two weeks' salary. 
 Medium performance -  a month's salary. 
 High performance -  two months' salary. 

 Those are real good incentives. You'll get a different result here. 

 What happened was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward. 

This time around, the people offered  the top reward did worst of all. 
Higher incentives led  to worse performance. 

What's interesting is that it isn't that anomalous. 

This has been replicated over and over again by psychologists, by sociologists and by economists - over and over and over again. 

For simple, straightforward tasks,  "if you do this, then you get that", they're great! 

For tasks that are algorithmic, a set of rules you have to follow and get a right answer, "if then" rewards, carrot and stick, outstanding!  

But when a task gets more complicated, when it requires conceptual, 
creative thinking,  those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work. 
但当一项任务变得更加复杂时，当它需要概念性、创造性思维时，这些激励因素显然就不起作用了。

Fact - money is a motivator at work, but in a slightly strange way. 
事实上——金钱是工作的动力，但方式有点奇怪。

If you don't pay people enough,  they won't be motivated.  There's another paradox here. 

The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table, so they're not thinking about money,  they're thinking about the work. 
使用金钱作为激励因素的最佳方式是向人们支付足够的报酬，让他们不再考虑金钱问题，这样他们就不会考虑金钱，而是考虑工作。

Once you do that, there are three factors that the science shows lead to better performance, not to mention personal satisfaction -  autonomy, mastery and purpose. 
一旦你做到了这一点，科学表明三个因素可以带来更好的表现，
更不用说个人满足感了—自主性、掌控力和目标。

## autonomy
Autonomy is our desire to be self-directed, direct our own lives.  
自主是我们渴望自我指引、指引自己的生活。

In many ways, traditional notions of management run foul of that. 
在很多方面，传统的管理观念都与此相悖。

Management is great if you want compliance. 
If you want engagement, which is what we want in the workforce today, as people are doing more sophisticated things, self-direction is better. 
如果你是一个按部就的人，来自外部的管理就很棒。

当人们正在做更复杂的事情的时候，你会想要参与其中，这就是我们今天在工作中想要做的，自我指导会得到更好的结果。

Let me give you some examples of almost radical forms of self-direction in the workplace that lead to good results. 
让我给你举一些在工作场所中近乎激进的自我指导形式的例子，这些形式可以带来良好的结果。

Let's start with Atlassian, an Australian software company. They do something really cool. Once a quarter on a Thursday, they say to their developers,  "For the next 24 hours, you can work on anything you want the way you want, with whomever you want. 
在接下来的 24 小时内，你可以做任何你想做的事情，以你想要的方式，与任何你想要的人一起工作。

All we ask is that you show the results to the company in this fun meeting - not a star chamber session, but with beer and cake and fun  and things like that.
我们所要求的就是你们在这次有趣的会议上向公司展示结果——
不是明星会议，但有啤酒、蛋糕和乐趣之类的东西。

It turns out that that one day of pure, undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software,  a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise would never emerge - one day. 
事实证明，那是精彩的一天，纯粹的、未稀释的自主性带入到对现有软件的一系列修复，以及对新产品的一系列想法，否则这些想法永远不会出现

This is not the sort of thing  that I would have done  before I knew this research.  
我知道这项研究之前，我不会做这样的事情。

I would have said,  "You want people to be innovative? 
 "Give them a frickin'  innovation bonus. 
 "If you do something cool, 
 I'll give you $2,500." 
 
 They're saying, "You probably want to do something interesting. 

 "Let me get out of your way." 

 One day of autonomy produces things  that had never emerged. 

## mastery
Let's talk about mastery - 
our urge to get better at stuff. 
我们想要在事情上做得更好的冲动

We like to get better at stuff. This is why people play musical instruments on the weekend. 

These people are acting in ways that seem irrational economically. 
They play musical instruments? Why? 
It's not going to get them a mate or make them any money. 
Cos it's fun. Cos you get better at it and that's satisfying. 

I imagine that if I went to my first economics professor, a woman named Mary Alice Shulman, and I went to her in 1983 and said,  "Professor Shulman, can I talk to you after class? I got this idea for a business model and I want to run it past you. Here's how it would work. 

You get a bunch of people around the world who do highly skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time - 20, sometimes 30 hours a week.

She's looking somewhat sceptically there. 

"But I'm not done! Then what they create, they give it away rather than sell it. 
 "It's gonna be huge!" 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 She would have thought I was insane.

It seems to fly in the face of so many things, but you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers in Fortune 500 companies, Apache powering more than the majority of web servers, Wikipedia. 

What's going on? Why are people doing this? Many are technically sophisticated, highly skilled people who have jobs.

OK? They have jobs! 
They're working at jobs for pay, doing sophisticated technological work. And yet, during their limited discretionary time, they do equally, if not more, technically sophisticated work, not for their employer, but for someone else for free. 

That's a strange economic behaviour. Economists have looked into it. 

"Why are you doing this?"  It's overwhelmingly clear - challenge and mastery, along with making a contribution, that's it. 
挑战和掌握，以及做出贡献，就是这样。

What you see more and more is the rise of the "purpose motive".
你越来越看到的是“目的动机”的兴起。
More and more organisations want some kind of transcendent purpose. 

Partly because it makes  coming to work better,  partly because that's the way to get better talent. 
部分是因为它可以让工作变得更好，
部分是因为这是获得更好人才的方式。

What we're seeing now is when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive, bad things happen. 
我们现在看到的是，当利益动机与目的动机脱节时，

Ethically sometimes, but also bad things, like "not good stuff"!  Like crappy products.  Like lame services.  Like uninspiring places to work. 

When the profit motive is paramount or when it becomes completely  unhitched from the purpose motive,  people don't do great things. 
当利润动机至高无上或完全脱离目的动机时，人们就不会做出伟大的事情。

More and more organisations are realising this, disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's purpose. 

I think that actually heralds something interesting.  The companies that are flourishing - profit, not-for-profit or somewhere in between - 
 are animated by this purpose motive.

我认为这实际上预示着一些有趣的事情。 蓬勃发展的公司——
营利性、非营利性或介于两者之间的公司——都
受到这种目的动机的推动。

Let me give you some examples. 
The founder of Skype says, "Our goal is to be disruptive, but in the cause of making the world a better place." 

Pretty good purpose. Here's Steve Jobs.  "I want to put a ding in the universe." 

That's the kind of thing that might get you up, racing to go to work. 

I think we are purpose maximisers, not only profit maximisers. 

I think the science shows that we care about mastery very deeply  and that we want to be self-directed. 
我认为科学表明我们非常关心掌握，并且我们想要自我指导。

I think that the big take-away here is that if we start treating people like people, not assuming that they're simply horses - slower, smaller,  better smelling horses - if we get past the ideology of carrot and stick and look at the science, we can build organisations and work lives that make us better off. 

They also have the promise to make our world just a little bit better.
