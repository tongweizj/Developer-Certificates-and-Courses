# Welcome to Grade 12 English - Introduction

In this course, you will explore and critically think about the concept of resilience from three perspectives.
在本课程中，您将从三个角度探索并批判性地思考韧性的概念。

## The individual

个人

You will start the course by examining the connection between learning and resilience on a personal level. You will also explore literary examples from individuals who overcame challenging situations and think about what you have experienced in your life.

您将通过在个人层面上检查学习和适应力之间的联系来开始课程。 
您还将探索克服困难情况的个人的文学例子，并思考您在生活中经历过的事情。

## The community

Then, you will consider how communities have overcome adversity through the power of words, voice, and media.
然后，您将考虑社区如何通过言语、声音和媒体的力量克服逆境。

## The human race

Finally, you will use your new understanding of resilience to examine texts through a selection of critical lenses. Each lens raises important questions about the human condition and human interactions.

最后，您将运用对复原力的新理解，通过精选的批判视角来检查文本。 
每个镜头都提出了有关人类状况和人类互动的重要问题。

You will use your understanding of critical lenses to complete your culminating project(Opens in new window). In Unit 4, you will select a novel to read independently, and use what you have learned in this course to create a comprehensive reading journal for the culminating project, which you will submit at the end of the course. If you would like to get a head start on choosing and reading your novel, feel free to go ahead and explore Learning Activity 4.1 to learn about the novel options you can choose from and the novel selection process you should follow to make an informed choice. If you would like to begin to work on your reading journal for the culminating project, explore Learning Activity 4.2 for specific instructions and guidelines on developing a reading journal.

## Connecting to transferable skills

Ontario worked with other provinces in Canada to outline a set of competencies that are requirements to thrive. Ontario then developed its transferable skills framework as a set of skills for students to develop over time. These competencies are ones that are important to have in order to be successful in today’s world.

随后，安大略省制定了可转移技能框架，作为学生随时间发展的一套技能。 
这些能力对于在当今世界取得成功非常重要。
