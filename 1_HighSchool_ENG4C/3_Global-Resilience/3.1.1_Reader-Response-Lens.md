> Reader response theorists recognize that texts do not interpret themselves.

Having written your reader response analysis, compare your thinking to the sample provided.  
写完读者反应分析后，将您的想法与提供的示例进行比较。

#### Sample reader response analysis

There are a few elements that surprised me in “Cinderella.” The main one was that Cinderella wasn’t interested in material possessions like her stepsisters, but wouldn’t she have been jealous when she saw what her father gave them? I think I would be, and I think that would make it very difficult to have a good relationship with him. In my family, it was critical that all siblings received the same kind of gift at birthdays and other celebrations to keep the jealousy to a minimum.  
《灰姑娘》中有一些元素让我感到惊讶。主要是灰姑娘不像她的继姐妹那样对物质拥有感兴趣，但当她看到父亲给她们的东西时，她不会嫉妒吗？我想我会的，而且我认为这会让我很难与他建立良好的关系。在我的家庭中，所有兄弟姐妹在生日和其他庆祝活动时收到相同类型的礼物至关重要，以将嫉妒降到最低。

If I was Cinderella, I don’t think I could have been as docile or accepting of my circumstances. I would have been so angry at the injustice. It makes me wonder what characteristics Cinderella possessed to be so calm and fair. She is willing to serve. Is this a good quality? I’m not sure because it allowed her to be taken advantage of, but it is also a quality that I admire. She is a confusing character.  
如果我是灰姑娘，我想我不会那么温顺或接受我的处境。我会对这种不公正感到非常愤怒。我不禁想知道灰姑娘到底有什么特质，才能如此冷静、公正。她愿意服务。这是一个好的品质吗？我不确定，因为这让她被利用了，但这也是我钦佩的品质。她是一个令人困惑的角色。

This Brothers Grimm version is quite different from the version that I am familiar with. It is much more graphic, violent, and cruel. This was surprising and made me wonder why. Why did the story change?  
这个格林兄弟的版本和我熟悉的版本有很大不同。它更加生动、暴力和残酷。这很令人惊讶，也让我想知道为什么。为什么故事发生了变化？

Another big difference is that Cinderella’s father doesn’t die in this version. He is there to witness the life that Cinderella is living and how she is being taken advantage of. Why doesn’t he stop it? Why does he marry the cruel woman? Why does he have such a low opinion of Cinderella? He doesn’t act the way I think a father should.  
另一个很大的区别是灰姑娘的父亲在这个版本中没有死。他在那里目睹灰姑娘的生活以及她如何被利用。他为什么不阻止呢？他为什么要娶这个残忍的女人？为什么他对灰姑娘的评价这么低？他的行为不像我认为的父亲应该做的那样。

The level of violence in this story is very disturbing and really changes the story for me from an innocent fairy tale that I heard growing up to a violent story not meant for children at all.  
这个故事中的暴力程度非常令人不安，对我来说，这个故事确实从一个我成长过程中听到的无辜童话故事变成了一个根本不适合儿童的暴力故事。
