### Welcome to Unit 3!

> Most misunderstandings in the world could be avoided if people would take the time to ask ‘what else could this mean?'
> 如果人们花时间问“这还意味着什么？”，世界上大多数误解都可以避免。
> – Shannon L. Alder, author

As you've experienced in the course so far, people have different ways of **perceiving** the world. 
When it comes to defining resilience, for example, different people will have different **interpretations**. 解释
**For some**, resilience is more about strength and **hardiness**. 力量和坚韧
**For others**, it's about **adaptability** and **flexibility**. 适应性和灵活性

Having your own **perspective** doesn't mean that you shouldn't become familiar with the perspectives of others. 观点
In fact, comparing perspectives and having a global understanding of the various perspectives will often **strengthen** your own.

Reading a text is similar. You can interpret the text through different literary lenses to **broaden** your perspective and think critically about what you are reading. 
In this way, you can examine the work from a perspective different from your own and thus, get a more global understanding of the work and its meaning.

In this unit, you will learn to put on **four literary lenses**文化视角:
- Reader response lens, 
- Historical/biographical lens, 
- **Psychological** lens, 
- and Gender lens. 

Don't worry if some of these lenses are unfamiliar. You will be learning more in this unit.

For now, select the Suggested Guidelines tab for some important information on using literary lenses.

 **Suggested Guidelines**
>
>- Each lens requires background knowledge to apply it.
>- No single lens can be used for all literature.
>- Different lenses focus on different aspects of a text.
>- Some texts provide more insights when viewed through a specific lens.
>- It is common to combine lenses for a new interpretation.
>- There is no single way to interpret literature.
>- Literary lenses can also be referred to as schools of thought, literary theories or literary criticisms. These terms are often interchangeable.

By taking a multi-faceted view of a text, you can widen your perspective and have deeper insight on a text.


#### Transferable skills

As you work through the activities in this unit, you will also be developing and demonstrating a variety of transferable skills:

- Critical thinking and problem solving
- Innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship
- Self-directed learning
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Global citizenship and sustainability
- Digital literacy


At the end of Unit 2, you set some goals for yourself. Review your goals and think intentionally about which areas you will work to improve. You will reflect on your progress at the end of this unit as well.

In this learning activity, you will focus on the reader response lens and historical/biographical lens. 

It's time for a quick introduction to each of these lenses. Select the following tabs to read a description of each lens.

You will now have an opportunity to take a deeper dive into the reader response lens and historical/biographical lens. First, select the following reader response lens to learn more about the lens. When you're done, return to this main page and select the historical/biographical lens to learn more about that lens.
