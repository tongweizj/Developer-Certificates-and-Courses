> **Historical criticism 历史批评**: The historical approach to literature simply means that the critic – the person trying to understand any work of literature – looks beyond the literature itself to the broader historical and cultural events that might influence the author whose work is being considered.  
> ：文学的历史方法仅仅意味着批评家——试图理解任何文学作品的人——超越文学本身，关注可能影响其作品正在被考虑的作者的更广泛的历史和文化事件。Source:  来源：eNotes.com

> **Biographical criticism 传记批评**: Biographical criticism emphasizes the relationship between the author and his or her literary work ... [C]ritics look for glimpses of the author’s consciousness or life in the author’s work.

## Think 思考

Think back to Unit 2 and your lyric analysis.  
回想一下第二单元和你的歌词分析。

- How important was the political and social context to your understanding of your song?  
    政治和社会背景对你理解歌曲有多重要？
- How would your song change if it were written in a different time about a different social movement?  
    如果你的歌曲是在不同的时间写的，关于不同的社会运动，它会发生什么变化？

As you may recall, you have already had some experience analyzing texts through this lens.  
您可能还记得，您已经有了一些通过这个镜头分析文本的经验。

Historical/Biographical analysis is based on questions such as the following:  
历史/传记分析基于以下问题：

- To what extent is the writing style of the text typical for the time period?  
    文本的写作风格在多大程度上是那个时期的典型？
- How do the language, characters, or events reflect when and where the author was writing?  
    语言、人物或事件如何反映作者写作的时间和地点？
- Are there significant events in the author’s life that are important to the text?  
    作者一生中是否有对文本重要的重大事件？
- What were the author’s intentions when writing?  
    作者写作时的意图是什么？
- Who is the intended audience?  
    目标受众是谁？
- What was happening politically, economically, and socially when the text was written?  
    当文本写作时，政治、经济和社会正在发生什么？

In order to use the historical/biographical lens effectively to analyze literature, you will need a more detailed understanding of this lens. For instance, the historical/biographical lens can be called “New Historicism” and, even more broadly, “Cultural Studies.” Remember this for your research.  
为了有效地使用历史/传记镜头来分析文献，您需要更详细地了解这个镜头。例如，历史/传记镜头可以被称为“新历史主义”，更广泛地说，可以被称为“文化研究”。请记住这一点以供您的研究使用。

**Historical and Biographical Context Related to the Brothers Grimm  
与格林兄弟相关的历史和传记背景**

By Emily Brown 艾米莉·布朗

Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Carl Grimm (1786-1859) were well known German scholars who collected and assembled folklore into documented fairy tales. In order to understand their adaptation of these folk tales, one must first understand the history, social movements, and motivation behind their work.  
雅各布·路德维希·卡尔·格林（Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm，1785-1863 年）和威廉·卡尔·格林（Wilhelm Carl Grimm，1786-1859 年）是著名的德国学者，他们收集民间传说并将其整理成记录的童话故事。为了了解他们对这些民间故事的改编，我们必须首先了解他们作品背后的历史、社会运动和动机。

As children, Jacob and Wilhelm played games that might have seemed peculiar to other children. Jacob often liked to organize the many old items that were scattered throughout the Grimm’s attic, while Wilhelm liked to sort through the collection of insects that he and his brother collected together. These activities foreshadowed their “Sammlergeist” (“collector spirit”) as well as their tendency to work together. This tendency they possessed lead them to collect and organize folk tales, folk songs, myths, legends, children’s games, proverbs, epic poetry, and put together a German dictionary during their adulthood. (Kamenetsky 12)  
小时候，雅各布和威廉玩的游戏对于其他孩子来说可能很奇怪。雅各布经常喜欢整理散落在格林阁楼各处的许多旧物品，而威廉则喜欢对他和他的兄弟收集的昆虫进行分类。这些活动预示了他们的“Sammlergeist”（“收藏家精神”）以及他们的合作倾向。这种倾向促使他们在成年后收集整理民间故事、民歌、神话、传说、儿童游戏、谚语、史诗，并编撰了一本德语词典。 （卡梅涅茨基 12）

Along with their natural tendency to sort and collect, the Grimm brothers were deeply influenced by Romanticism, a social movement brought on by the Enlightenment. Romanticism was in full swing during the brothers’ lives and created a new interest in culture, tradition, and the people of Europe. Many German Romantics wanted to create a unique identity for Germany by compiling things such as its history, language, and folklore. Jacob and Wilhelm contributed to this creation of identity, with their most famous work being Kinder- ind Hausmärchen or Children’s- and Household Tales. This work was published for the first time in 1812 and was revised many times after.  
除了天生的分类和收集倾向之外，格林兄弟还深受启蒙运动带来的浪漫主义社会运动的影响。兄弟俩一生中浪漫主义如火如荼地展开，并引发了人们对欧洲文化、传统和人民的新兴趣。许多德国浪漫主义者希望通过整理德国的历史、语言和民间传说等内容来为德国创造独特的身份。雅各布和威廉对这种身份的创造做出了贡献，他们最著名的作品是《Kinder-ind Hausmärchen》或《儿童和家庭故事》。该书于1812年首次出版，此后多次修订。

Kinder- und Hausmärchen was a compilation of folktales directly gathered from German peasants. Romantics viewed peasants as being close to nature and God. Their pure and simple way of living was considered a treasure, and they were known for having strayed less from tradition than other social classes. This made them the best and most accurate sources for Jacob and Wilhelm to collect folklore from.  
Kinder- und Hausmärchen 是直接从德国农民那里收集的民间故事的汇编。浪漫主义者认为农民接近自然和上帝。他们纯粹而简单的生活方式被认为是一种财富，而且他们以比其他社会阶层更少偏离传统而闻名。这使它们成为雅各布和威廉收集民间传说的最佳和最准确的来源。

Historically, folktales were originally used for adult entertainment. The Brothers Grimm compiled these folktales together for two main reasons. First and foremost, they were attempting to organize German culture in a way that could be studied effectively. Each story and any deviants that were recorded were included in the collection. Their intention was not to state that there were similarities between stories, but to display these similarities in a way that was undeniable to the reader. Secondly, they intended these stories to be entertainment for children. This followed Charles Perrault’s example, who made the “fairy tale” genre popular.  
从历史上看，民间故事最初是用于成人娱乐。格林兄弟将这些民间故事编撰在一起有两个主要原因。首先也是最重要的是，他们试图以一种可以有效研究的方式组织德国文化。记录的每个故事和任何异常行为都包含在该集合中。他们的目的并不是要指出故事之间存在相似之处，而是以读者不可否认的方式展示这些相似之处。其次，他们想让这些故事成为孩子们的娱乐。这遵循了查尔斯·佩罗的榜样，他使“童话”类型变得流行。

Knowing these few background details about the creation of Kinder- und Hausmärchen gives insight into many components of the compilation. Using this information can lead to an intelligent analysis of the work and can open doors into further exploration.  
了解《Kinder- und Hausmärchen》创作的一些背景细节可以让您深入了解该汇编的许多组成部分。使用这些信息可以对工作进行智能分析，并为进一步探索打开大门。

**“Chicken Hips”** “鸡臀”
by Catherine Pigott 作者：凯瑟琳·皮戈特

The women of the household clucked disapprovingly when they saw me. It was the first time I had worn African clothes since my arrival in tiny, dusty Gambia, and evidently they were not impressed. They adjusted my head-tie and pulled my lappa, the ankle-length fabric I had wrapped around myself, even tighter, "You’re too thin," one of them pronounced. "It’s no good." They nicknamed me "Chicken-Hips."  
家里的女人们看到我，都发出不以为然的咯咯笑声。自从我来到尘土飞扬的小冈比亚以来，这是我第一次穿非洲衣服，显然他们并没有留下深刻的印象。他们调整了我的头带，把我裹在身上的长及脚踝的布料拉得更紧，“你太瘦了，”其中一人说道。 “这不好。”他们给我起了个绰号“鸡臀”。

**“A Handful of Dates”**  
“一把枣子”
by Tayeb Salih 塔伊卜·萨利赫

Short story published, originally in Arabic in 1964, in a collection of stories "The Wedding of Zein". The action of this story, as with many of the stories written by El Tayeb Salih, occurs in the fictional setting of the village of Wad Hamid, which is in Central Sudan. This short story is told through the eyes of a young boy as he experiences an epiphany, a critical moment of awareness that perhaps marks his passage from a child to an adult. The boy's love and admiration for his grandfather is diminished as the boy listens to his grandfather describe Masood and observes the treatment of the man, for whom the young boy feels a likeness.  
短篇小说，原版于 1964 年以阿拉伯文出版，收录在故事集《玉米蛋白的婚礼》中。与埃尔·塔耶布·萨利赫写的许多故事一样，这个故事的情节发生在苏丹中部瓦德·哈米德村的虚构背景中。这个短篇故事是通过一个小男孩的眼睛来讲述的，他经历了顿悟，这是一个关键的意识时刻，也许标志着他从一个孩子到一个成年人的转变。当男孩听祖父描述马苏德并观察祖父的待遇时，男孩对祖父的爱和钦佩逐渐减弱，他觉得自己与祖父很相似。

**“The Pedestrian” 《行人》**
by Ray Bradbury 雷·布拉德伯里

To enter out into that silence that was the city at eight o'clock of a misty evening in November, to put your feet upon that buckling concrete walk, to step over grassy seams and make your way, hands in pockets, through the silences, that was what Mr. Leonard Mead most dearly loved to do. He would stand upon the corner of an intersection and peer down long moonlit avenues of sidewalk in four directions, deciding which way to go, but it really made no difference; he was alone in this world of A.D. 2053, or as good as alone, and with a final decision made, a path selected, he would stride off, sending patterns of frosty air before him like the smoke of a cigar.  
十一月的一个雾蒙蒙的晚上八点钟，走进这座城市的寂静，把脚踩在弯曲的水泥路上，跨过青草的接缝，双手插在口袋里，穿过寂静，这是伦纳德·米德先生最喜欢做的事情。他会站在十字路口的拐角处，从四个方向凝视月光下长长的人行道，决定走哪条路，但这实际上没有什么区别；他在公元2053年的这个世界上孤身一人，或者说几乎是孤身一人，做出了最后的决定，选择了一条道路，他就会大步走开，在他面前吹起雪茄烟雾般的冰冷空气。

**“Plight” “困境”**
by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson  
作者：莉安·贝塔萨莫萨克·辛普森

Lucy, Kwe, and I walked through the neighbourhood last fall; when all the trees looked like the time Nanabush hid his Kokum in there — like the maples were being swallowed by flame-arms of red and orange. We marked each one with a spray-painted purple thunderbird so that when their leaves were gone we would know which ones were the sugar maples the following spring. Really we should be able to tell by looking at the bark and the way the branches hold themselves, but we're still too new at it. Kwe was so pregnant I made her stand back from the paint fumes. Lucy made a stencil so the thunderbird would look like a thunderbird and not the death mark the city puts on the trees when they are about to cut them down for safety reasons.  
去年秋天，露西、奎和我走过这个街区。当所有的树木看起来就像纳纳布什把他的科库姆藏在那里的时候一样——就像枫树被红色和橙色的火焰臂吞没一样。我们在每一棵树上都喷上了紫色的雷鸟标记，这样当它们的叶子消失时，我们就能知道哪些是来年春天的糖槭树。事实上，我们应该能够通过观察树皮和树枝的固定方式来判断，但我们对此还太陌生。奎已经怀孕了，我让她站在油漆烟雾后面。露西制作了一个模板，让雷鸟看起来像雷鸟，而不是城市出于安全原因准备砍伐树木时在树木上留下的死亡标记。

**“Legends are Made, Not Born”**  
“传奇是创造出来的，而不是诞生的”
by Cherie Dimaline 通过 切丽·迪马琳

MY MOM WAS A CATHOLIC HALFBREED who named me after a pack of smokes, Semaa-tobacco. She died in a fiery blaze of glory winning a snow-mobile race. My father, also a Catholic halfbreed, had no say in what I was to be named and wasn't around to explain her death. He's less important here, though he did remain a steady if infrequent fixture in my later life until he died, less adventurously, at eighty-four, in an old age home.  
我的妈妈是一个天主教混血儿，她以一包烟给我命名，Semaa-烟草。她在赢得雪地摩托比赛的荣耀中死去。我的父亲也是一名天主教混血儿，他对我的名字没有发言权，也没有在场解释她的死因。他在这里不那么重要了，尽管他在我后来的生活中确实是一个稳定的、虽然不常见的固定人物，直到他八十四岁在养老院去世，不那么冒险。

As you read your chosen story, use the reading strategies you have practiced in previous learning activities. Take some time to review them (if needed) by pressing the following tabs.  
当您阅读所选故事时，请使用您在之前的学习活动中练习过的阅读策略。按以下选项卡，花一些时间查看它们（如果需要）。

#### Ask yourself questions  
问自己问题

For example, ask yourself, “What does the writer mean by …?” or “What do I need to know more about to understand …?”  
例如，问自己：“作者所说的……是什么意思？”或“我需要了解更多什么才能理解……？”

#### Adjust your pace  
调整你的步伐

If you find the text challenging, take more think time to process meaning. You may need to reread or pause to think and review.  
如果您发现文本具有挑战性，请花更多思考时间来处理含义。您可能需要重读或停下来思考和回顾。

#### Read between the lines  
字里行间

Link ideas and draw conclusions. Consider what is implied, or suggested, as well as what is clearly written on the page.  
链接想法并得出结论。考虑暗示或建议的内容以及页面上明确写的内容。

#### Visualize  可视化

Develop a mental image as you read. Some people describe reading a novel as “a movie running through their minds.”  
阅读时在心里形成一个形象。有些人将阅读小说描述为“在他们的脑海中播放一部电影”。
#### Make predictions  作出预测

As you read, think about what might happen next.  
当你阅读时，想想接下来会发生什么。

#### Take notes  做笔记

You can add notes in the margins of a text to track ideas and literary elements and to ask questions about what the author means. Consider consulting this [Annotation guide(Opens in new window)](https://course.ilc.tvo.org//content/enforced/22862564-ENG4C-EN-02-02-ON-(I-D-0922)/course_content/assets/locker_docs/eng4c_03.01.46.html?ou=22862564) and digital annotation tools such as the comment feature in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Taking notes can also involve creating a vocabulary list of unfamiliar words and their definitions.

#### Make connections  建立联系

Make connections between what you are reading and your own knowledge and experiences. What does the text remind you of? How does the text relate to other things you have learned, seen, heard about, or done? This is sometimes called “mental Velcro,” because you are attaching new information to ideas you already have.  
将您正在阅读的内容与您自己的知识和经验联系起来。文字让你想起什么？这篇文章与你学到的、看到的、听到的或做过的其他事情有什么关系？这有时被称为“心理魔术贴”，因为你将新的信息附加到你已有的想法上。

### Notebook 笔记本

Even when you are using a literary lens to analyze a story, you should still be ready to deconstruct the story using what you know about plot, character, and theme.  
即使当您使用文学视角来分析故事时，您仍然应该准备好利用您对情节、人物和主题的了解来解构故事。
