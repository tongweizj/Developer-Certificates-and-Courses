Students without part-time jobs or dependents, living with others who do most of the household tasks, generally have between 25 to 30 hours for study. For everyone else, it depends on their particular situation, and each person copes differently.<br /></span></span></p>
<h2>What's the "sand" in my life?</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Based on the result of your questionnaire and what you now know about the program, do you think that you will have sufficient time for your studies to do well? If not, where is the "sand" in your life?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">If you have much less than 15 hours available,&nbsp; you may face a lot of stress, so you should consider whether this is the right time for you to be studying in a full-time program and consider getting assistance from the trained personal counsellors at the College. This is a "free" service (included in your fees!), and all discussions are confidential. However, some students with inadequate time decide to just do their best and accept the results. This may mean lower grades or even having to repeat courses, but they understand that they are learning, and learning a new language takes time. This acceptance reduces the pressure and allows students to work at their own pace. The most important think to remember is that the only right answer is what is right for YOU!&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
