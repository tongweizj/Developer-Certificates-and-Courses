<p><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In post-secondary education, learning matters, and grades matter too! In highly competitive situations, Marks can make the difference between getting into a program or not, for example, the medicine or dentistry programs at the University of Toronto. In many programs, students must achieve a certain grade in their major subjects to proceed to the next semester. Therefore, grades do matter. They are one of the many sources of feedback to the student regarding their performance and should be used as feedback.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Every student wants an A or an A+, and when the mark received is very different, what can the student do? Let's explore this in this sub-module.</span></span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="color: #660000;">The Importance of a Rubric</span></span></h2>
<span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the EAP Program, you can expect to receive a rubric for any piece of graded work you submit, and most often before you submit the assignment. A rubric is a consistent way of assessing students' work. It tells you the different factors that will be evaluated and the marks to be given for each factor. A rubric takes the person out of the assessment. A teacher is not assessing Mary or John. The teacher is assessing the work submitted by Mary or John.</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #660000;">It is sometimes difficult for students to separate their grade from their identity and their relationship with their instructor--if I get a good grade, my instructor likes me, and I'm OK. If I get a bad grade, my teacher perhaps doesn't like me, and I feel worthless. In addition, in some countries, it is often possible for a student to complain to the head of a department to complain about their low marks, and for the department head to assign a higher mark. This does not happen in the EAP Program. This is why the rubric exists--the work is evaluated against the descriptions in the rubric.</span> </span><br />
<h2><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="color: #660000;">Using your graded work as feedback</span></span></h2>
<span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When you receive graded work, you should be able to examine the rubric to know where you lost marks and how you can do better the next time. Maybe the content and ideas of your paragraph were fine, but your grammar needs improvement. Use the rubric to guide your future effort. You may not like your grade, but you understand how you got that grade, based on the rubric.</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However, occasionally a student really disagrees with the mark received. What should the student do?</span></span>
<h2><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 18pt;">Meeting with your professor to discuss your grade</span><br /></span></h2>
<span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Book an appointment with your professor and have a constructive approach to the meeting. It is not a good idea to ask for a meeting immediately after receiving your graded work with a disappointingly low mark. Your meeting is likely to be emotional or an angry outburst. Take your work home, study the rubric to see where you lost marks, re-check your work, and make notes for your meeting. The goal is to have a constructive meeting with your professor and identify how you can improve, so prepare your approach:</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Here are approaches that will not be helpful:</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></div>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">"You always give me a bad mark."" (Consider that your work is always below the standard.)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I'm studying really hard, and I never get a good mark from you." (Professors don't mark effort; they mark the work produced.)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">These approaches are emotional statements, and the student hasn't made any request of the professor. </span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Here is a better approach:</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">"I notice that I got a X out of Y marks for Z, according to the rubric. Can you help me understand why it's so low? Can you tell me what I need to do to get a higher mark?"</span> </span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #660000;">In this approach, the student is asking the professor to go through the work and explain how the mark was derived, based on the rubric. The student is also asking for specific items that</span> </span></span><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">need to be included to get a higher mark. In this way, the student can study those specific items for the next test.</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;">I<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">n this meeting, a student can also ask the professor to reconsider the mark. However, it is important to be reasonable. In a narrative paragraph, where simple past tenses are being assessed, don't expect to have your work re-considered for a higher mark if there are about 20 verb tense or verb form errors. If the professor agrees to reconsider the mark, the work will either be re-marked by the same professor or another professor who teaches the same subject. Also, consider that such a request may result in a lower mark by someone else!</span></span><br />
<h2><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #660000; font-size: 18pt;">When to meet with the professor</span></h2>
<span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #660000;">A student has 10 days from the time a piece of graded work is returned to ask for a meeting with the professor, but it is a good idea to schedule a meeting within five days. Getting early, specific feedback on how to improve is important.</span></span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Generally, most students are satisfied with the outcome of their meetings. However, what happens if the </span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">student really believes that the work done deserves a higher mark? This is the step for a formal grad</span>e appeal, <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">and this has to be done within 10 days of the work being returned.</span></span></div>
<h2><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #660000;">A Grade Appeal</span></h2>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #660000; font-size: 14pt;">A grade appeal is a formal step taken when a discussion with your professor does not result in a changed grade. To understand how the grade appeal works, study this <span style="color: #20124d;"><a href="204,%20Grade%20Appeal%20Form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #20124d;">Grade Appeal Form</a></span>. Then read the case study below, write your response to the questions, and bring them to class for discussion. <br /></span></div>

<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #660000;">Manouche is a Level Two student who received a D on his first paragraph writing test and a D+ on his second. He did not ask to meet with his professor when his work was returned. It is now Week 12, and he's concerned that he will fail the third writing test, which will be written in Week 13. He files a formal grade appeal with the Chair for his first two tests. Do you think he will succeed? Why or why not?</span></span></div>
