<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Full-time studies require the same time commitment as a full-time job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Most employees work 40 hours, and this does not include travel time. The EAP Program is a full-time, intensive English language program, so as an EAP student, you should aim to spend at least 40 hours of time on your studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Your total EAPP class hours with your professors, the two-hour lab class, and the one-hour seminar account for 22 hours. Therefore, you should aim for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>about</strong><strong> 18 hours for homework and studying each week</strong></span>. In addition, if you think that certain skills are weak, you may have to plan to devote more time for that skill. </span></p>

<h2>What if I have a part-time job?</h2>
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here is what York University here in Toronto advises students on its website, and this is for all students, not just for ESL students:</span>
<h2 src="/shared/Templates/ModernRed/einstein_brain.jpg" alt="Cartoon brain" style="width: 489px; height: 198px;"><em><span style="color: #073763; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">"Many students work part time while in school. Keep this in mind: a&nbsp;full course load (30 credits or 5 full courses during the Fall/Winter terms) is a full-time job, roughly equivalent to a 40-50 hour work week. Some students may be able to do an additional 10 hours of part-time work on top of this, but more than 10 hours would likely compromise your course work."</span></em></h2>
