<h2><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Analyzing How I Spend My Time</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Time is like money in the bank. Know how much money there is to spend before spending it. In order to plan your study time, you need to know how much time you have available, and this will depend on your personal circumstances and situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Most of us cannot quickly change our life circumstances--married, with school age children, aging or sick parents, living far from the college, part-time jobs, recent newcomers just settling in, not living with spouses, etc. These situations often bring very time-consuming responsibilities. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">How much time do you have for your studies? This is simple math: <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: #cf2a27;">[All my available time] minus [ time for required daily living activities] = time available for my studies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Use the questionnaire below to help you see how you generally spend your time each week. Consider the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>average</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>amount of time you give to each activity. In some weeks, you will use more time and in some weeks, less, so give sufficient <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>average</strong></span> time. When you answer all the questions, the box at the bottom will tell you how much time you have available for studying. Make a note of this number. Then print the completed survey. You will need both for the assignment. If you make a mistake, just repeat the survey. Now start the <a href="http://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/time_scheduling/where_does_time_go.html" target="_blank">questionnaire.</a> <br /></span></p>
